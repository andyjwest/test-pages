A flash of incomprehenislbe horror goes through her mind. &quot;Its here. I hear you. I&#x27;m coming.&quot;</p><ul><li>Narra Stargazer, elvish astronomer upon discovering a strange comet&#x27;s landing site. </li></ul><p>5th edition brought a surprising twist with the Warlock class when it released. The class was uniquely different from anything else from the playtest. It brought a popular theme from RPGs and stories that was unexplored in Dungeons and Dragons: the Great Old Ones.</p><p>These entities add a new dynamic to 5th edition. Worlds that have a focus around one of these elder gods look closer to a Lovecraft novel and less like a classic Conan fantasy. From the iconic <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> to N&#x27;zoth and C&#x27;thun of World of Warcraft, DMs have a huge array of tools to draw inspiration from in order to bring a unique feeling to the table when dealing with Old Gods and the madness that is so often closely tied to them.</p><p>This guide aims at giving DMs and Players new tools for roleplaying in these environments as well as general advice for playing games with a madness or “Old God” feel to them.</p><h2>Player Options</h2><p>Players who enter a world where an all powerful entity readies to devour all existence might want tools to match this epic theme. Here we present two main ways to embrace the play style: Madness Domain (a redux of Trickery) and alternate Warlock familiars more fit for an incomprehensible elder entity.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=138kreWGwguUcveB6jrpmPingq77VsA7m">Here</a> are the options, presented in a printer friendly PDF form.</p><p>Now on to inescapable doom!</p><h2>World Building</h2><p>Worlds riddled with mad prophets and elder gods playing with mortals for entertainment are also full of adventure. Mad cults worshipping these evil entities spring up and threaten the entire surrounding environment with their horrific rituals and sacrifices. Old, abandoned churches can find new life in the hands of mad clerics and priests eagerly praying to gods of insanity that grant otherworldly strength.</p><p>The key idea we are going to be focusing on from here on out is the concept of <strong>cosmic horror</strong>. The following advice and ideas stem from my own understanding of pop culture views of the Great Old Ones and the genre surrounding their founding stories. I am by no means an expert in the genre but rather a casual observer. These scenes and ideas are drawn from  a variety of popular works.I would encourage anyone looking to delve deeper into the genre to seek out  Lovecraftian-style literature; cult classic horror movies such as IT or the Thing; or video games like Darkest Dungeon’s DLC, the Color of Madness.</p><blockquote><h3>The Cosmic Horror Contrast</h3><p>DnD presents the party as heroic actors taking action and shaping the world around them. These PCs matter. Their decisions change the universe and might even make powerful entities consider them on the cosmic level.</p><p>Cosmic horror stories tend to focus on human insignificance and can be a great tool to combat the players at the table. The party stands firm that the races of the realm matter in the cosmic scheme of things while the opposition of elder gods and insanity focus instead around the chaotic nature of the universe and the insignificance the party holds.</p><p>It thusly becomes up to the party to prove the genre wrong. They must stand up and <em>matter</em>. The world literally revolves around them. They must prove it, against  all odds, when combating the massive horrors that come with insanity and great old ones working only to prove the insignificance of any one individual in the multiverse. </p></blockquote><h3>Environments</h3><p>Like many horror settings, cosmic horror stems from subtle alterations to reality but also extends to incomprehensible visions and locations of pure insanity. Setting up players with vivid descriptions can set expectations for the feel and approach they are looking toward when moving forward. When making settings based around Great Old Ones, consider focusing in on pop culture views of the genre. Common descriptions include slimy, glistening surfaces;  wild and unnerving shifts in expression and mood; and dreary colors that don’t naturally belong. </p><p>A focus on cosmic scale can help set the mood in these environments. An environment’s depiction of stellar maps and astronomical devices can set up the otherworldly appearance that  compliments the Great Old Ones and their monstrous followers. </p><h4>Descriptions</h4><p>When setting the stage for a cosmic horror style adventure, consider using some of the following words to embellish your environment. Before jumping in with your players, consider how to apply these words to your specific environment. What might this calm farmstead look like after months of rain? A festival ground can be quite disturbing when the life and fun has drained and only dismal passerbys populate its area. </p><p>These two tables should provide some extra adjectives to help immerse players in a world tormented by Eldritch evils. </p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">d10</th><th style="text-align:left">Environment Descriptor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1</td><td style="text-align:left">dismal</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:left">depressing</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3</td><td style="text-align:left">gloomy</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4</td><td style="text-align:left">bleak</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">5</td><td style="text-align:left">glistening</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">6</td><td style="text-align:left">sodden</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">7</td><td style="text-align:left">sullied</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">8</td><td style="text-align:left">in disrepair</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">9</td><td style="text-align:left">revolting</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">10</td><td style="text-align:left">maddening</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">d10</th><th style="text-align:left">Character Feature Descriptor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1</td><td style="text-align:left">outcasted</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:left">depressed</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3</td><td style="text-align:left">fearful</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4</td><td style="text-align:left">convulsing</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">5</td><td style="text-align:left">blank expression</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">6</td><td style="text-align:left">gibbering</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">7</td><td style="text-align:left">traumatized</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">8</td><td style="text-align:left">twitching</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">9</td><td style="text-align:left">hopeless</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">10</td><td style="text-align:left">hysterical</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>General Atmosphere</h4><p>Worlds full of cosmic horror can look any number of ways. Monsters from outside the bounds of reality don&#x27;t often give friendly aid, and the environment the inhabitants live in tends to suffer. Structures built for these extraplanar entities can look wildly diverse. Some might be simple churches that have small inconsistencies that hint at horrible secrets happening below the surface while another might be a massive stone obelisk coated in unknown runes along side images depicting a writhing monster of tentacles and mind bending patterns.</p><p>When describing your environments, start small. Cosmic horror melds well with mystery. The unknown is its own character that is always lurking at the edge of scene. Players should frequently be growing more concerned and suspicious of the ordinary. As one puzzle is solved, it reveals three more that have been hidden in plain sight all along. All eventually will point to our big bad but ease into it to aid in the feel of cosmic horror.  </p><p>The following tables give some ideas, descriptive elements, and objects that you can incorporate into any old environment to reinforce the impending doom the party faces. These descriptors are broken down into three categories based on how deep into the mystery the party is: “everything is basically fine”, “wait, what’s that?”, and “oh shit we’re all totally going to die-- horribly!”.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">d6</th><th style="text-align:left">Everything is Basically Fine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1</td><td style="text-align:left">A painting of a young man and woman who gaze into the stars, but the stars all are neon green</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:left">A building with its windows being repaired and some loose teeth scattered outside the door.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3</td><td style="text-align:left">All the structures face a single statue in the center of town</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4</td><td style="text-align:left">Animals are nearly absent, and those that do appear are seen fleeing the area or stressed.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">5</td><td style="text-align:left">Townsfolk often whisper to each other about the party.

Often, players’ imagination will push them into crazy conspiracy theories  that can in turn can inspire your plot development down the road. </p><h4>Designing Dungeons</h4><p>Time for some dungeon interior decoration! From sacrificial chambers to otherworldly ritual chambers, the rooms you choose to include in your dungeons around eldritch monsters can lead to a stand-out dungeon that feels like it belongs in a greater story. Regular rooms, like mess halls and barracks, could look entirely different when dedicated to servants of Great Old Ones. </p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">d8</th><th style="text-align:left">Dungeon Room</th><th style="text-align:left">Descriptive Elements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1</td><td style="text-align:left">Sacrificial Chamber</td><td style="text-align:left">ominous persistent blue light, stone occult decorations on a stone sacrificial slab, tentacle images and statues throughout the room</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2</td><td style="text-align:left">Mad Library</td><td style="text-align:left">Warped and rotting wood shelves, living eyes affixed to book covers, no clear organization, text written in multiple seemingly random languages at once, occult symbols and incomprehensible gibberish written over regular text</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3</td><td style="text-align:left">Animal Pens</td><td style="text-align:left">Glass tubes containing roiling sludge that seems to crawl closer as its watched, dissected squid like creatures twitching on lab tables, journals showing unknown monsters with scientific notes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4</td><td style="text-align:left">Barracks/Bunks</td><td style="text-align:left">Simple, near empty, possessions all seem to be coated in scratches and drawings, vomit stained sheets</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">5</td><td style="text-align:left">Dining Hall</td><td style="text-align:left">Aquatic ornaments decorating benches and chairs, centerpieces all strange occult objects and statues, single dim light source in the center of the table, squid/fish like monsters disguised as food on table</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">6</td><td style="text-align:left">Ritual Chamber</td><td style="text-align:left">Bizzare rune circles, focal point around single figure in center, walls and tables covered in alchemical supplies and strange spell components</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">7</td><td style="text-align:left">Observatory</td><td style="text-align:left">Old damaged telescopes and worn charts cover tables, a magnificent crystal ball shows the vastness of the Astral Plane, a mix of religious and scientific instruments</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">8</td><td style="text-align:left">Extraplanar Chamber</td><td style="text-align:left">Empty and airless, hissing sounds and disfigured abominations visible in the distance, a lone, floating door in a seemingly random location in the emptiness</td></tr></tbody></table><p>How you frame dungeon exploration also plays a pivotal role. A focus on light, temperature, and atmosphere are crucial to creating an immersive experience. Stone walls feel slimy and/or like the interior of a living being. Torches might barely function and magical light and darkvision cease functioning entirely. Patterns can clearly be recognized in the strangest placese but don’t obviously reveal the sinister truth the dungeon protects. </p><p>These kinds of challenges are aimed at showing the party how small they are as well as present so much of the dungeon as unknown. This will tie into our goal of approaching cosmic horror within D&amp;D. Hazards and monsters in these dungeons are out to prove player insignificance.</p><h4>Closing Thoughts</h4><p>Cosmic Horror and Great Old Ones can be a great change of pace from a regular D&amp;D game. They can act both as the driving force behind a huge story arc as well as a small side quest to distract players from the standard fantasy world they have been used to exploring.</p><p>Share with us your thought about the Great Old Ones in D&amp;D- do they not fit well in your worlds?
