# Be a Better: Bladelock
<img src="https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1445748953900.jpg">
A tiefling in a jester costume dances gleefully in an baron's court. Her eyes dart around the cheering crowd of nobles looking for her mark, vibrant plumage and cheering jests holding the crowd in a entranced state of joy. As she spins and conjures flames to juggle, she finally spots the ambassador she's been hunting for her patron. She approaches the ambassador with a bouquet of flowers. As he reaches for the roses, smiling and laughing, a dagger wreathed in flames with a demonic eye in the handle appears from thin air in her off-hand. The ambassador didn’t have time to gasp before his throat was slit open, and the jester vanished into thin air. 

One of the most popular ways to play the Warlock class is building around the Pact of the Blade feature. The fantasy is incredible. A character is gifted a weapon from their Otherworldly Patron: a dagger from the nine hells, a rapier from a fey queen, a trident from a kraken god. All of these promise a fantasy that largely leaves players feeling underwhelmed once they use it in practice. With the right context and expectations, I believe the feature can deliver without needing to look outside the Player’s Handbook. Today we're going over how to get the most out of Warlock Pact of the Blade!

## Feature Breakdown: Pact of the Blade

> ### Pact of the Blade
>You can use your *action* to **create** a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this **melee** weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon **counts as magical** for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
>
>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
>
>You can transform one Magic Weapon into your pact weapon by performing a Special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears **whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter**. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
>

At its core, pact of the blade is a utility feature, not a combat feature. Gaining a weapon from your patron implies its use in combat. In practice it just tends to act as an expanded proficiency boost into martial weapons normally with only a 1-3 point difference in average damage. The feature itself doesn't provide any huge boosts in early combat. The magical property does come in handy with specific enemies, but isn’t the core power the feature brings. 

Pact of the Blade provides players with a huge toolbox of weapons to call to their side at will. Players don't have a single weapon forged by their patron but instead an armory of weapons ready to be summoned. This means you are never unarmed, have no trouble hiding your weapons, and can mix up what weapons you bring each time you summon one. A bladelock never needs to worry about having an incriminating weapon on them that would tie them to the scene of a crime, and could even frame another by selecting an unusual weapon tied to the character!

The feature does not specify that the weapon must come from the base weapon table in the equipment section of the book. With DM permission, this opens up your options into exotic territories as well that can have a major impact both in and out of combat. You are proficient in any weapon you conjure including martial and exotic weapons, so get creative!

Below is a list of weapons the increase your ability to influence the world in and out of combat from the PHB equipment table.

##### Utility Pack Weapons
|Weapon| Damage| Properties|
|:--|:--:|:--|
|Dagger| d4 piercing| Finesse, light, thrown (20/60), **aquatic**|
|Handaxe| d6 slashing| Light, thrown (20/60)|
|Glaive| d10 slashing| Heavy, two-handed, reach|
|Trident| d6 piercing| Thrown (20/60), versatile (d8), **aquatic**|
|Whip| d4 piercing| Finesse, reach|
|Lance| d12 piercing| Reach, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made against creatures within 5 feet of you, two-handed (while unmounted)|

This list supports a huge array of builds but also can slot into many existing builds. Need to break an object far away? Conjure a throwing hammer and break smash it at a distance! Need a 10 foot long rope on the fly? A whip is your best friend! Find yourself shipwrecked and doing battle with merrow? Grab a trident and fight with ease! You can summon an axe to cut down trees and a warpick to clear the caved in entrance to the dungeon.

> ### The Aquatic Weapon Property
>
> A mini hotfix within this Be a Better! Underwater combat is fairly simple in 5e, but it can be difficult to find which weapons work normally and which don’t. In a nutshell, weapon attack rolls made under water have disadvantage unless they are from a specific list or the user has a swim speed.
>
> The aquatic weapon property removes the rule text from underwater combat and moves it to the affected weapons! The following changes occur:
>
> "When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart)."

> "When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll. A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range, and has disadvantage against a target within normal range."
>
> In addition to these changes, daggers, javelins, shortswords, spears, tridents, crossbows, and nets all have the **aquatic** weapon property.
>
> #### Aquatic
> This weapon ignores any penalty to attack rolls it would receive from making weapon attack rolls under water.
>
> This does cause some thrown weapons to perform slightly worse, but in exchange we make it abundantly clear which weapons work underwater. A worthy sacrifice for simplification. 


## Ability Scores

Pact of the Blade's flexibility encourages two core ability scores: Strength and Dexterity. Charisma is the recommended as the go to stat for Warlocks but isn’t as neccisary for Pact of the Blade Warlocks. By prioritizing spells that don’t require spell attack rolls or saves, bladelocks can juice their combat focused stats to increase their damage output and survivability. Spells like *hex*, *friends*, *mage hand*, *armor of agathys*, and *invisibility* all don’t interact with your spell attack bonus or spell save DC at all while supporting melee and utility focused characters. Having a few spells that still require these attributes isn’t awful, but will require a bit more planning and setup to find the most success with these features. 

Dexterity as a primary stat opens the most doors for bladelocks. It boosts your AC, ranged weapon attacks and damage, and melee finesse weapon attacks and damage. Shortbows are simple weapons. Picking one up opens up your character to also having a decent ranged option, and a pair of shortswords can deal solid damage in the early levels when paired with *hex*. 

Alternately, focusing more on Strength and Constitution gives you a more “tanky” warlock. Greatswords hit like a truck, and you can swap between any number of weapons to get the job done. Need an open hand? Grab a longsword! Something resistant to slashing damage? Time for a maul! Prioritizing these two stats with Dexterity as your third produces a beefy character. Add onto that any of the ample temporary hit point effects within the class or AC boosts and you can get away with an even lower Dexterity if you would rather take a decent Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma. 

## Supporting Features
By itself, Pact of the Blade can be an excellent supplemental feature to other core builds. Its similar to the Conjuration Wizard's *Minor Conjuration* feature with a bit more limitation. That on its own can be hugely valuable to Warlocks with Dexterity or Strength as their highest or second highest ability score.

What if you want to build around a specific weapon, though? If you have the desire to take a warped fiendish greatsword into battle, you can pick up a few warlock spells/invocations to push the power of your weapon up a notch.

### Hex
Hex is the single spell I'd recommend to every Warlock looking for consistent damage. It is similar to Sneak Attack. In specific builds, early on it can outperform that feature when two weapon fighting is employed. Any bladelock worth their salt should pick up Hex if they are looking to navigate combat and want to dish out a comparably fair amount of damage with rogues and paladins.

This spell can be built upon along side Pact of the Blade. If you take the Two Weapon Fighting feat, you can conjure a rapier in your main hand and draw a short sword for the highest damage two-weapon fighting build out there. With *hex* adding a bonus d6 damage on marked targets, you'll be dealing 1-2d6 bonus damage a round on top of regular weapon damage.

Even for non two-weapon fighting builds, bringing a 2d6+4 greatsword damage to 3d6+4 is substantial. It additionally can free up your bonus action slot a bit more, giving your more flexibility in combat.

Moving your hex around can require some planning and group coordination to maximize its effectiveness, and often you'll find yourself tackling a single huge enemy while your allies deal with their hordes of underlings so you can get the most out of your actions. This is particularly noticeable in two-weapon fighting builds where you are juggling your off-hand attack with reapplying hex.

Hex works in all manner of Pact of the Blade Warlock builds. It grants bonus damage regardless of weapon choice, and has a huge cast range to be actively powerful for thrown weapon builds and melee builds alike. It flourishes with characters with high AC or high constitution to have the best chances at maintaining concentration while in the thick of things. 

### Temporary Hit Points
If you are looking to support a melee centric character outside of raw damage, the Warlock class offers a variety of ways to gain hit points. Fiendish Vigor (*false life* at will), *armor of agathys*, and the fiend's Dark One's Blessing all give you ways to gain temporary hit points and fit great into a variety of different play patterns.

Fiendish Vigor often acts as 8 temporary hit points whenever you get out of combat as you can just continue to recast it until you have maximum temp HP. Setting up an encounter with either this or *armor of agathys* means by the time your temporary hit points expire, you'll be just about ready to get a refresh with Dark One's Blessing whenever you drop an enemy. 

These features can provide survivability for the character and can work great in two-weapon fighting builds or single weapon Strength builds. It does require some party coordination to juice these features to the max, but with a bit of practice this build can be quite powerful.  


### Pact of the Blade Invocations
The Player's Handbook comes with two invocations that interact directly with Pact of the Blade: Thirsting Blade and Lifedrinker.

Thirsting Blade gives you the Extra Attack feature and pushes Pact of the Blade warlocks into Fighter and Paladin ranges of damage. Extra Attack is a huge damage bonus. It plays well with *hex*, *faerie fire* and your other weapon attack centric features. Making two greatsword attacks a turn is normally all Fighters can hope to get at 5th level. Warlocks learn a new spell, get a new eldritch invocation, and improve their Pact Magic spell slots to third level. Forgoing the invocation to gain extra attack effectively is Thirsting Blade and should show you how powerful of a feature it is compared to what Barbarians and Fighters are gaining here.

Once you get to 12th level, Lifedrinker might start to look lackluster. It is far from that. With an 18 in Charisma, you are adding +4 to all of your weapon damage rolls. With two greatsword attacks, your dishing out 4d6+16 damage with two hits. Just two. Add hex with your bonus action and it jumps to 6d6+16 damage per round to a single target, every round, all day. Two-weapon builds push the feature even further. Three attacks gives us an extra +4 damage (as we don't get to add our Dex to the damage of off-hand weapon attacks), making our potential damage per round with hex 6d6+20, split into two groups of 2d6+8 and one 2d6+4. This kind of damage is powerful, even at 12th level, and can be used consistently with only 1 Pact Magic spell slot.

The core issue with Lifedrinker is the Charisma requirement. It asks you to have a primary or secondary stat in Charisma to get the most out of it, which might not reach its maximum potential in some bladelock builds. 
 
### Other Notable Feats and Features

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ogE34cm.jpg">

Amplifying greatsword builds with Great Weapon Master just makes sense. It gives you more choices when swinging your greatsword around, and can push your damage into ludicrous territory. The feat is bonkers. Always take the penalty. +10 to damage is insanity, and making an extra attack when you down an enemy makes a slayer build with Dark One’s Blessing insane. 

Dual Wielder gives you a slight bump to AC and damage if you are conjuring a rapier and going in on a Dexterity based build. Hybrid builds with Strength based two-weapon fighting also is fine, but tends to have slightly less survivability in exchange for more opportunities to use brute force to explore with.

Martial Adept is a one of the best general feats a Bladelock can pick up. It is similar to picking up an extra spell slot but only for combat spells, and often these maneuvers can be combat warping. Picking up Parry or Rally gives you an extra tool to aid your allies while Riposte and Tripping Attack give the Bladelock even more tools to pump out combat damage. Riposte + Hex + Greatsword = a metric truckload of damage to a single creature.

Savage Attacker is a criminally underrated feat in dice heavy builds. It unfortunately does not allow you to reroll your Hex damage [(sage advice)](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/01/26/does-the-savage-attacker-feat-apply-to-sneak-attack-or-divine-smite/) but being able to reroll your low rolls on 2d6 can be great. You can opt in any time you want- the feature is always available.

Devil's Sight paired with *darkness* is a Warlock classic that goes great with weapon builds as well. While *darkness* does take up your concentration slot, the advantage you get on attacks and the disadvantage your enemies will be forced to take makes the option appealing to multi-attack builds. It helps that independently both features are excellent utility features as well.


## Closing Thoughts
You can play a powerful blade lock in a variety of ways with expectations VS your investment in the build. The feature is incredibly flexible. It can act as a simple, yet flexible, utility feature but also can be built around with the bonus proficiencies it grants.
