## Hotfix: Long Rest Spell Invocations

Gibby looks back at the Kalimor and Sigmond- surely the goblins will spot the impossible to hide wizard and paladin. Garbed in gaudy purple robes, the halfling warlock's eyes glow bright pink. He leaps out in front of the patrolling goblins. "Hey! Hey! Over here!" He shouts out, weaving words of luck under his breath while signaling for his allies to start running. He can feel his own luck start to fade as two more groups of goblins turn the corner and see him. Little do the goblins know, their luck has changed as well- as they pursue the distracting halfling, they can't seem to catch a break as they trip over themselves and fail to notice the elderly wizard and clunky, yet dashing, paladin escape with their treasures. 

Today on Hotfix we're looking to address a category of Warlock invocations that don't get much love from the community: invocations that cast one spell using a spell slot per long rest.

Here are the six invocations we'll be adjusting today: Thief of Five Fates, Mire the Mind, Bewitching Whispers, Dreadful Word, Sculptor of Flesh, Sign of Ill Omen. Minions of Chaos is deliberately absent- as is, summoning magic with short rest spell slots is uniquely powerful compared to these other options.

These invocations all share one key flaw: they consume a Warlock spell slot to let a Warlock cast a spell outside of their core spell list. What is so wrong with these features that they need a change?

1. Comparatively underwhelming to the other existing invocations 
2. Tie up two different Warlock resources in one choice
3. Fail to expand on or improve a play pattern 
 
### Our Three Fixes 
To address these invocations, we're going to be focusing on text all of them share. Here is their text box where the specific spell is replaced by *spell name*.

> #### Warlock Invocation
>
>You can cast *spell name* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
>

Here are our three potential solutions 
### Option 1: Quick Fix 
> #### Warlock Invocation
>You learn the *spell name* spell. You can cast *spell name* once without consuming a spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
 
This fix straight powers up the invocations. It both allows you to learn a spell otherwise outside the Warlock class and additionally gives you a free use once per long rest. Players that want to actively fit a spell like *slow* or *bane* into their character concept can do so with this change. Being able to use your regular slots to cast the invocation spell can help define an entire character build. 

In its current state, full on caster Warlocks that utilize a hefty spell list to act are not well supported. While they shouldn't compete toe to toe with Wizards and Sorcerers, having access to a specific spell one additional time goes a long way to supporting a desired play style. This provides warlocks with more stuff to do- it still has resource overlap but expands that resource a bit with an extra free use. It still locks down their concentration slot which can hurt dedicated *hex* builds. 

This feature doesn't make the invocations feel epic, though. They end up just being a simple expanded spell list. How do we make unique, engaging invocations out of these?

### Option 2: Remove Concentration 
> #### Warlock Invocation 
> You can cast *spell name* once without consuming a spell slot. If the spell requires concentration, it no longer requires concentration and lasts until no creatures are affected by it or until its duration ends. 

By removing concentration on the spells and giving them a single free use per long rest, these invocations can act as encounter shaping effects. These invocations can now fit into many more builds than before as their concentration slot can still be used for spells like *hex*. 

This fix gives players more reasons to consider these invocations by increasing the number of opportunities warlocks can use them. Consider now that players don't have to worry about what spells they tend to normally be concentrating on and can instead use these spells in circumstances other classes wouldn't be able to.

Any mechanic that breaks a core rule of the game tends to be powerful. Having an extra concentration slot, even when for a specific spell, is powerful. This version removes the resource overlap entirely- now players don't have to juggle concentration spells with their Pact Magic and these invocations. They are less build defining now but instead build supporting. Players take these invocations to supplement existing play styles that already use their concentration slot instead of building around these concentration spells. 

These invocations also now play nicely together. The more you have, the more concentration spells you can have up at once. In an epic finale, having up three concentration spells can feel powerful. 

If the option still feels too weak at the table, however, consider adjusting it further from once per long rest to once per short. Can we make them stand out even more? Can they both be build defining and unique? 

### Option 3: Give and Take 
Alright, this is a weird one- one of my weirder designs. This specific option would exclude Sculptor of Flesh and Sign of Ill Omen. Hear me out:
> #### Warlock Invocation
> You can cast *spell name* at will, without expending a spell slot. While at least one other creature is affected by the spell, you suffer the spells effect as well. Once no other creature is affect by the spell, the spell ends.

This option gives Warlock something they have been asking for since their conception: a way to sacrifice to make others suffer. The class fantasy of making a deal with the devil tends to be all upsides- here is a powerful feature that has a significant downside. *Slow* at will can be powerful and build defining- but are you willing to also be slowed? Bestowing a curse on your enemies as a fey lock seems on point- but as a mortal wielding fey power, you too suffer from the misfortune *bane* brings. 

This change is the most volatile and potentially game breaking, but also the option I'd be most excited to pick up as a Warlock. Maybe some characters only need on action on their turn- *slow* warlock builds could be a thing. Casting bane frequently to set up encounters can make a status effect focused Warlock more engaging and encourage mechanical builds that don't want to be making attack rolls or ability checks in combat. 

This makes the invocations build defining similarly to Misty Visions and Fiendish Vigor. It would likely become a major part of the character's kit, and I think would shake up the table the most from being introduced. These should be handled with caution, but if you are looking to bring something new and fresh to the table without leaving the comfort of the PHB, these fixes might be for you

## Wrapping Things Up
Warlock invocations make the class the amazing toolbox class it currently is. Character customization is the core foundation of the class and while tend to never be the best at something, they always bring a huge array of features to the table to explore the world around them in unconventional ways.

How do you think these fixes would change the Warlock class? Have you taken these invocations unchanged and really enjoyed them? Do you think these changes are desperately needed or entirely pointless? What changes would you bring to the table to address Minions of Chaos?
