## Adventure Presentation Ideas 

### Simplicity Model
*Shows quickly and clearly main points to run. The "one page adventure"*

**Core Conflict.** 
The adventure is centered around these conflicts.
1. Granny Pusstoe is looking to collect her decennial sacrifice from Veldali, the Green Child. 
2. Xavior Solem wants his kingdom back, and finds Veldali in control of it. 

**Party Objective.** 
Steer the party to: 
1. Defeat Granny Pusstoe and free Veldali from her coven.
2. Negotiate and reclaim the castle for Xavior.

**Stakes.**
Should the party fail, 
1. Xavior (or a party member) is sacrificed to a dark ritual and Veldali remains imprisoned by coven magic.
2. The kingdom remains lost, and Pusstoe grows stronger. 

**Plot Hooks.**
To get the party there,
1. have Xavior start knowing the party already, and asking for a favor in return for future riches. 
2. inform the players about hushed rumors and whispers spread around town about twisted dark magic coming from the woods every decade.
3. persuade the players with the possibility of great riches and magical treasures buried in an ancient abandoned castle. 
4. exicte the players with a promise of exploration in a rich, fantastical world through childrens stories and excited kids.

**Critical NPCs.** 
The main characters within the story are:
- **Xavior Solemn.** A gold dragonborn treasure hunter who is the heir to a long forgotten kingdom. He's excited and headstrong. Always the optimist, he believes he's found a map to an entire kingdom that he is the rightful heir to, and eagerly wants to explore it for both its riches and personal gratification. He doesn't know the full extend of what happened to his ancestors, but upon learning about it, he likely becomes more horified than angry. His temperment is pure, and while he may seek fortunes, he does so for the thrill of adventure more so than greed. 
- **Veldali, the Cursed Child.** A human cursed child who is hundreds of years old. She has green skin, sickly skin, tangled black hair and filthy noble garb she's pilfered from the castle she lives in. Veldali is a tragic character who was cursed as an infant by Granny Pusstoe. She was captured and imprisoned by Xavior's ancestor, and broke free by unleashing the curses magic on the kingdom. Her magic terrifies her, and she feels civilization is safer the further she is from it. Practice has given her better control over her magic, and she currently acts as a protector of the woods and castle she confines herself too. 
- **Granny Pusstoe.** A powerful green hag who has tormented vilages and kingdoms across the realms for generations. She too has green, sickly skin and black, twisted hair, but is far more grotesque. She is covered in warts, has a mishapened nose, and one eye is sewn shut with black thread. She has forced Veldali into a twisted coven now that she is older, and in exchange for leaving the surrounding villages alone, forces her to sacrifice one humanoid every decade to fuel their coven's magic.
