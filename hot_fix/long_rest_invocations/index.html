With a quick whisper to his fey patron, magical luck seeps out of him as an offering and in return fuels is magic. After a breif moment, the sentry yelps and leaps from his chair, darting towards the nearest bathroom. Gibby can feel his own luck being pressed, but he&#x27;ll take anothers misfortune at the moment to progress towards the soon to be ill-gotten gains. </p><p>Today on Hotfix we&#x27;re looking to address a category of Warlock invocations that don&#x27;t get much love from the community: invocations that cast one spell using a spell slot per long rest.</p><p>Here are the six invocations we&#x27;ll be adjusting today: Thief of Five Fates, Mire the Mind, Bewitching Whispers, Dreadful Word, Sculptor of Flesh, Sign of Ill Omen. Minions of Chaos is deliberately absent. Summoning magic with short rest spell slots is uniquely powerful compared to these other options.</p><h3>When to Change these Invocations</h3><p>You might consider using these hotfixes in place of the core invocations in a variety of circumstances. Because of how comparitively weak the options are perceived when judged against other invocations, players tend to steer away from these and towards more reliable and epic invocations. If your players are having a hard time picking a play style that suits them or feel that they fantasy they are building towards should include one of these weaker invocations, consider this hotfix as a starting point! </p><p>These invocations are generally recieved as underwhelming because they are: </p><ol><li>comparatively underwhelming to the other existing invocations </li><li>tie up two different Warlock resources in one choice (both Eldritch Invocations and Pact Magic) </li><li><p>fail to expand on or improve a play pattern </p></li></ol><h3>Our Three Fixes</h3><p>We&#x27;re going to be focusing on text all of them share when hotfixing today. Here is their text box where the specific spell is replaced by <em>spell name</em>.</p><blockquote><h4>Warlock Invocation</h4><p>You can cast <em>spell name</em> once using a warlock spell slot. You can&#x27;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p></blockquote><p>Here are our three potential solutions.</p><h3>Option 1: Quick Fix</h3><blockquote><h4>Warlock Invocation</h4><p>You learn the <em>spell name</em> spell. You can cast <em>spell name</em> once without consuming a spell slot. You can&#x27;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p></blockquote><p>This fix directly powers up the options. It allows you to both learn a spell outside the Warlock spell list and gives you an additional use once per long rest. Players that want to actively fit a spell like <em>slow</em> or <em>bane</em> into their character concept can do so with this change. Using normal spell slots with your invocation bonus spell can become build and play pattern defining. </p><p>In its current state, Pact Magic focused Warlocks that utilize a hefty spell list to interact with the world are not well-supported. While they shouldn&#x27;t compete toe-to-toe with wizards and sorcerers, having access to a specific spell one additional time goes a long way to supporting this desired play style. The invocations would still overlap with Pact Magic, but also expands that resource a bit with an extra free use. It also still locks down their concentration which can hurt dedicated <em>hex</em> builds. </p><blockquote><h4>Warlocks Comparative Place</h4><p>Warlocks have a wonderful home in D&amp;D. By mixing Pact Magic, Invocations, and Pact Boons, players are able to design their own niche character that focuses around a single theme. These focuses tend to be either jack of all trade style characters who dabble in a variety of areas or hyper-focused characters who excel at doing exactly one thing over and over again. </p><p>Wizards and Sorcerers both have more robust spell lists and more spell slots for a reason. Both lack the choice and flexibility Warlock has access to. Invocations and Boons both give Warlocks reusable tools to act in the world and is the largest part of their comparative advantage against the other classes. </p><p>When working on the Warlock class, consider these areas of power carefully. In our example, we are trying to bring some of the less frequently used invocations up to par with other existing invocations. We don&#x27;t want the option to start outshining other classes in fields they are designed to excel at. </p></blockquote><p>This feature doesn&#x27;t make the invocations feel epic, though. They end up just being a simple expanded spell list. How do we make unique, engaging invocations out of these?</p><h3>Option 2: Remove Concentration</h3><blockquote><h4>Warlock Invocation</h4><p>You can cast <em>spell name</em> once without consuming a spell slot. If the spell requires concentration, it no longer requires concentration and lasts until no creatures are affected by it or until its duration ends. Once you use this invocation, can&#x27;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></blockquote><p>By removing concentration on the spells and giving players a single free use per long rest, these invocations can act as encounter shaping effects. Consider a player enters an encounter and immediatly causes havoc with a <em>confusion</em> spell. Next round, regardless of who is still affected, the player is free to move into their regular play pattern by setting up their <em>hex</em> or <em>witch bolt</em>. These invocations now fit into character builds they didn&#x27;t before because players can use their bread and butter concentration spells without fear. </p><p>Any mechanic that breaks a core rule of the game tends to be powerful. Having an extra concentration slot, even for a specific spell, is powerful. This version removes the resource overlap entirely. Players wouldn&#x27;t have to juggle concentration spells with their Pact Magic and these invocations. They are less build defining now but instead build supporting. Players take these invocations to supplement existing play styles that already use their concentration slot instead of building around these concentration spells. </p><p>These invocations also play nicely together. The more you have, the more concentration spells you can have up at once. In an epic finale, having up three concentration spells can feel powerful. </p><p>If the option still feels too weak at the table, consider adjusting it further from once per long rest to once per short. Can we make them stand out even more? Can they both be build defining and unique? </p><h3>Option 3: Give and Take</h3><p>Alright this is one of my weirder designs. This specific option would exclude Sculptor of Flesh and Sign of Ill Omen. Hear me out.</p><blockquote><h4>Warlock Invocation</h4><p>You can cast <em>spell name</em> at will, without expending a spell slot. While at least one other creature is affected by the spell, you suffer the spells effect as well. Once no other creature is affected by the spell, the spell ends.</p></blockquote><p>This option gives Warlock something they have been asking for since their conception: a way to sacrifice to make others suffer. The class fantasy of making a deal with the devil tends to be all upsides. Here is a powerful feature that has a significant downside. <em>Slow</em> at will can be powerful and build defining, but are you willing to also be slowed? Bestowing a curse on your enemies as a fey lock seems on point, but- as a mortal wielding fey power- you too suffer from the misfortune <em>bane</em> brings. </p><p>This change is the the option I&#x27;d be most excited to pick up as a Warlock but also the most volatile and potentially game breaking option. <em>Slow</em> warlock builds could focus around getting the most value from your action each round and ignoring bonus actions. Casting <em>bane</em> frequently to set up encounters can make a status effect focused Warlock more engaging and encourage mechanical builds that don&#x27;t want to be making attack rolls or ability checks in combat. </p><p>This makes the invocations build defining similarly to Misty Visions and Fiendish Vigor. It would likely become a major part of the character&#x27;s kit, and I think would shake up the table the most from being introduced. These should be handled with caution. If you are looking to bring something new and fresh to the table without leaving the comfort of the PHB, however, these fixes might be for you.</p><h2>Wrapping Things Up</h2><p>Warlock invocations make the class the amazing toolbox class it currently is. Character customization is the core foundation of the class. While they aren&#x27;t always the best at any specific option, Warlocks always bring a huge array of features to the table to explore the world around them in unconventional ways.</p><p>How do you think these fixes would change the Warlock class? Have you taken these invocations unchanged and really enjoyed them? Do you think these changes are desperately needed or entirely pointless? What changes would you bring to the table to address Minions of Chaos?
