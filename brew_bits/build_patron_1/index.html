The secret of their strange powers must lie somewhere in these lightless tunnels.

All I know is that when I uncover the magical nature and chemistry behind this patron I will be revered for years to-&quot; </p><ul><li>Kalimor Kalimorious, wizard extraordinaire, as he stumbled into a transparent gelatinous cube.</li></ul><p>Warlocks are the best tool box class 5th edition has to offer. They act as the most customizable option in the game. By third level, you have chosen your own Patron, Invocations, Spells, and Pact boon. Every feature you&#x27;ve obtained has offered customization choices. A huge part of the identity and popularity of the class comes from this customization. More importantly, the Otherworldly Patron drives player and DM imagination alike and inspires players to come up with unique and engaging characters.</p><p>Designing patrons for whatever purpose asks a lot of the creator. For today’s Brew Bits, we&#x27;ll break down Otherworldly Patrons in a step by step guide that can help you bring your own Otherworldly Entities to the table in ways the core books just don&#x27;t support. This is part 1 of a 2 part series, and we&#x27;ll be covering mainly the first level feature and expanded spell list here to give designers ideas to get their patrons under way. </p><p>Our warlock otherworldly patron that we&#x27;ll be using for reference is the Endless Ooze. Whether you are a worshiper of Jubilex, demon lord of oozes, or have contacted a plane encompassing hive mind ooze from the outer realms, the Endless Ooze brings the all the fun of the gelatinous cube and black pudding to your Warlocks!</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RZ0XZ271P1mh7Fmj7OSErrUquVDrSnCy">Here</a> is the printer-friendly PDF file for those looking for an easy print and play!</p><blockquote><h2>Otherworldly Patron: The Endless Ooze</h2><p>You have made a pact with a sentient otherworldly amorphous entity. These entities vary from hungering endless masses of acid to powerful demon lords looking to bring madness to the material. Jubilex, demon lord of oozes, and Ghaundaur, That Which Lurks, both serve as powerful entities eager to deal with mortals. You bargained with a powerful entity to borrow power that changes your physical form to become as mutable as an ooze. </p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The Endless Ooze lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. </p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Spell Level</th><th style="text-align:left">Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1st</td><td style="text-align:left"><em>grease, ray of sickness</em></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2nd</td><td style="text-align:left"><em>pass without trace, protection from poison</em></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3rd</td><td style="text-align:left"><em>meld into stone, stinking cloud</em></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4th</td><td style="text-align:left"><em>control water, stone shape</em></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">5th</td><td style="text-align:left"><em>contagion, passwall</em></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><h3>Mutable Form</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you borrow the ability to assume your patron&#x27;s amorphous form. You can use a bonus action to become <strong>amorphous</strong> until the end of the turn. While amorphous, any equipment you are carrying become amorphous with you. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, attacks of opportunity made against you while amorphous are made with disadvantage. </p><p>If you end your turn in a space that you would normally not fit, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are shunted.</p><h3>Aspect of the Ooze</h3><p>At 6th level, choose one of the following aspects to adopt: </p><p><strong><em>Gelatinous Cube: Transparent.</em></strong> As an action, you can mutate your form and any equipment you are carrying, becoming transparent for up to 1 minute. While you are not moving or taking other actions, it takes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you with a DC equal to your Warlock spell save DC + your Constitution modifier. A creature that tries to enter your space while unware of you is surprised by you. </p><p>Once you use this feature, it can&#x27;t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h5>Look out for the full option in an upcoming release with additional level 6 features!</h5><h3>Unnatural Constitution</h3><p>At 10th level, your patron grants you the resistances and constitution of an ooze. Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. </p><p>In addition, choose two of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold, fire, lightning. As a reaction to taking damage of the chosen type, you can reduce the total damage by 1d10+ your Constitution modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all expended uses upon completing a long rest.</p><h3>Consumption</h3><p>At 14th level, your body can mutate into a full ooze. As an action on your turn, a creature your size or smaller within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC or become engulfed inside you. You grow one size category and become translucent while a creature is engulfed in you.</p><p>An engulfed creature takes 6d6 acid damage. It can&#x27;t breathe, is restrained, and takes an additional 6d6 acid damage at the start of each of your turns.</p><p>An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a Strength check against your Warlock spell save DC+ your Constitution modifier. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you. </p><p>Once you engulf a creature with this feature, you can&#x27;t do so again until you complete you finish a long rest.</p></blockquote><h2>Feature Breakdown</h2><p>Existing warlock patrons tend to be built using the following design pattern.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Warlock Level</th><th style="text-align:left">Type of Feature</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1st</td><td style="text-align:left">A generic build around ability and an expanded spell list.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">6th</td><td style="text-align:left">A defensive feature that helps get you out of sticky situations.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">10th</td><td style="text-align:left">A passive defensive enhancement.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">14th</td><td style="text-align:left">A powerful tool that reflects the flavor of the class in a powerful way.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While it isn&#x27;t neccisary to follow this pattern, it’s a great starting guide for creating diverse Warlock features. I would encourage designers to at least include an expanded Warlock spell list at  to help define both the option&#x27;s flavor and mechanics.</p><p>There are a two core features that help provide context for desinging Warlock patrons. </p><p>Pact Magic gives warlocks frequent access to their spells, but in small doses. Short rest casting is a unique feature to warlocks and can easily feel oppressive if features are introduced that manipulate their Pact Magic spells. </p><p>Eldritch Invocations provide tremendous amounts of utility to the class. Look for overlap with existing invocations and Warlock spells and try to avoid creating features that Warlocks already have access too. This design choice can expand player options by giving them more tools to tinker around with when character building. </p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The expanded spell list provides new build around tools for warlocks and shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked. Being short rest casters means what few spells a Warlock knows can be a major part of their play pattern. Ideally, an expanded Warlock spell list opens up entirely new play patterns to Warlocks without neccisarily crossing into other classes&#x27; areas of expertise.</p><p>Here are the three questions to consider when deciding which spells should go in an expanded spell list.</p><h4>How does the spell reflect the flavor of your patron?</h4><p>This tends to be the most crucial element of a Warlock expanded spell list. Some patrons will have an easy time grabbing spells off other classes spell lists while others can be trickier. Our example emphasizes the stickiness and acidic aspect of oozes- they are unhealthy, gelatinous, festering creatures. To reflect their nature, we add spells like <em>grease, meld into stone,</em> and <em>stone shape</em> to reflect an oozes anatomy and give players ways to feel ooze-like.</p><h4>Can warlocks gain access to this spell outside of the expanded spell list?</h4><p>If a spell seems like a home run but can be gained outside adding it in an expanded spell list, I&#x27;d avoid it. Spells that are at will invocations are examples of spells I&#x27;d avoid putting on the Warlock spell list. Having overlap reduces the total number of options at a player’s disposal. We want to provide as many new ways to play as we can.</p><p>The spells <em>disguise self</em> and <em>altar self</em> work great for an ooze patron- adjusting your form to look different is within the shape changing, amorphous nature oozes bring to the table. Both are accessible within invocations, however. Players who want that aspect of oozes can already get it with invocations, so instead we chose different spells that fit within our patron’s flavor. This doesn&#x27;t close off ways to play Ooze-locks but rewards players who really want to go all out in their thematic elements within the base invocation list.</p><p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you <em>can&#x27;t</em> use flavorful spells on your expanded spell list if they already exist elsewhere in the class. I&#x27;d simply advise against it.</p><h4>What kind of play pattern do these spells support?</h4><p>This is the hardest question to answer. Some spells, when used frequently, shape how game play happens. For our example, <em>ray of sickness</em> is a scaling spell that works great with Warlock spell slots. It’s a damaging spell that encourages a ranged caster archetype for the patron while <em>grease</em> opens more of a utility/melee route by knocking enemies prone and controlling an area. </p><p>Spells to avoid would be long duration concentration spells and spells that summon additional creatures. Spells like <em>animate dead</em> can become oppressive when used on short rest refreshing spell slots. Consider how a spell would look if a player used it every hour- if the spell starts to function strangely or gives a player more resources than other classes gain from the spell, I&#x27;d consider not adding the spell to the expanded spell list. </p><p>We want to encourage frequent use of these spells, but only in a way that doesn&#x27;t push out other players from interacting in the world. If a warlocks army of animated zombies can plow through most traps and encounters, its detracting from other players problem solving opportunties and forcing the DM to build around a single particularly oppressive feature. </p><h3>Level 1 Feature</h3><p>A classes level 1 feature defines a huge portion of a character. Fiend warlocks have access to refreshing temporary hit points which encourages a reckless, combat centric character. Our Ooze patron&#x27;s Mutable Form encourages characters to explore otherwise inaccessible areas and deftly dodge in and out of melee combat.</p><p>The 1st level feature can be hugely diverse thanks to the other avalible choices within the Warlock class.</p><p>Warlocks are special because of their diversity of play styles. When creating a character from a different class, there is a predetermined idea of what kinds of styles the character will adopt in combat. Warlocks can diversify into full on spell casters in combat, maximizing the power of their cantrips and spell list. They could instead go for a more weapon centric build focused around Pact of the Blade and temporary hit points. Having access to shortbows makes ranged <em>hex</em> builds with supporting spells and invocations aimed at manipulating combat and flourishing outside of it. All of these basic examples show how diverse the class can be.</p><p>Consider one of the following approaches when designing a first level feature. These approaches overlap each other, but each has a set approach to appeal to different players. </p><h4>Flexibility</h4><p>Flexible features work in a variety of builds and are a gateway for players to build in a variety of ways. Mutable Form is an example of a flexible feature. Its bonuses in and out of combat give Ooze-locks a set of tools to build around or with. Players can take the option in a variety of directions. They can take melee centric spells to build a character that thrives in the thick of things. Alternately, they can focus more on infiltration and deception abilities to boost its exploration and role play potential. The option isn&#x27;t limited to these two paths, either. Creativity can drive players to work the feature into a the play styles that suits them best.</p><p>Flexbile features don&#x27;t reward a player for doing exactly one thing but instead give players a feature they can fiddle with. These often will be at will abilities that have powerful uses in and out of combat. Flexible features tend to fit somewhere in a play pattern but aren&#x27;t always the #1 action or bonus action the player is looking to take. Cunning Action is a great example of flexible feature outside of Warlock.</p><h4>Toolbox</h4><p>A toolbox feature focuses around giving players a unique and powerful tool to engage their environment with. The Fey feature, Fey Presence, is a great example of this. It has the potential to shift an encounter from loss to victory or be used as a get out of jail free type effect when the party is in a sticky situation. It can&#x27;t be repeatidly used, nor be entirely built around, but instead gives a player a powerful tool to use when needed. </p><p>Toolbox features tend to be limited in uses. Warlocks refresh the bulk of their power upon completing a short rest, but this doesn&#x27;t mean you absolutely have to limit toolbox style features to once per short rest. Features like a Light cleric&#x27;s Warding Flare can make excellent toolbox features and can be an excellent fit for a first level warlock feature. </p><p>These shouldn&#x27;t always be 100% effective. When toolbox features are tuned a bit too high, they can circumnavigate prepared encounters frequently and easily. Instead, look to push toolbox features towards being powerful in specific circumstances and just okay in most scenarios. As the name suggests, a toolbox feature can be one of many tools a warlock would turn towards to attack a specific problem.</p><h4>Build Around</h4><p>Build around features focus primarily on in or out of combat play patterns. The last two PHB options give us great examples of each. Dark One&#x27;s Blessing is a powerful build around feature for encounters while Awakened Mind is an excellent build around feature for exploration based characters.</p><p>The core of a build around feature is a powerful effect that can be improved. Dark One&#x27;s Blessing, for example, rewards players by having them deal more damage. The more creatures they down, the more temporary hit points they recieve. In addition, in order to maximize these hit points, the fiend-lock is encouraged to be in the thick of things or at least take some damage so they can continue to refresh the pool. </p><p>Alterantely, Awakened Mind wants a player to communicate telepathically with characters outside of combat. This encourages mental manipulation and negotiating. It acts as a shared language as well as a form of silent communication in role play environments as well as a tool for setting up ambushes silently with the party. It can easily be built around with supporting abilities that improve your Charisma skills or mess with a creatures mind. </p><p>Consider what supplemental features can improve a build around feature. How well supported is a particular play style? Dark One&#x27;s Blessing is supproted well with invocations like Armor of Shadows and the Pact of the Blade Pact Boon. Pact of the Chain supports Awakened Mind along side invocations like Misty Visions and Eyes of the Rune Keeper. Players can actively build towards a core theme, and at its center is the build around feature. </p><p>Build around features typically have unlimited uses and are &quot;always on&quot;. A player is looking to frequently take advantage of the feature and actively be using it in a wide array of environments to interact with the world. </p><h3>Closing Thoughts</h3><p>Don&#x27;t worry, more is coming soon on building Warlock patrons. This starting point can be all you need to build your own with a little creativity. </p><p>What Warlock Otherworldly Patron have you been itching to see at the table?
