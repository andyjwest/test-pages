By dim torchlight, Clarence leads his allies through the dank and decrepit mausoleum entrance. The light illuminates the backs of a group of patrolling zombies, each losing bits of themselves as they shamble. The light catches their attention- their heads swivel towards the paladin and his comrades. Dumb, dead stares lock eyes with the grinning chiseled-jaw human. Torch in one hand and blade in the other, blinding light erupts as Clarence cleaves his blade clean through the chests of the undead monsters. The zombies torsos slide off their legs, lifeless to the ground, dimly glowing where they radiance split them. 

A dwarf dawned in his own masterwork armor hides behind an iron statue of his ancestors- the monstrous demon thrashes about in the lava pools of their forge. He readies his axe, mutters a prayer, and turns the corner with a dwarfish battle cry. Orthos charges and leaps at the devil that triples him in size. Radiant flames lick the edge of his blade as it sinks into the chest of the Pit Fiend, splitting its scales and staining his armor in its fell blood. 

A halfling garbed in light chain and a leaf crown wanders through the forest. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices a flicker of pink light and wispy giggles. She looks about the woodland scene, a small frown forming on her face. Just as the fey trickster moves in from behind to strangle and devour it’s tasty halfling treat, her divine sense alerts her to this deception. She spins about and sinks her short halfling blade coated in poison into the shocked invisible faerie’s chest. "Not today, fey friend! These woods belong to the Barleylocks!" 

Today on Hotfix, we are looking at an iconic Paladin ability: Divine Smite. 

> #### Divine Smite (PHB 85)
>
>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

Divine Smite is a feature that causes quite a bit of trouble for some tables. The paladin class gets the opportunity to soak in tons of hits, make extra attacks, and add bonus damage dice on to those attacks. Compared to rogues, fighters, barbarians and rangers, paladins can bring a little too much power to the table and don't give the other characters enough time in the spotlight. It pigeon holes paladins into radiant slayers of undead needlessly while leading to a simple and linear play pattern. We’d like to open up more play options for the class, and addressing smite can help get us there. 

### When You'd Want to Change Divine Smite
1. Paladins at your table have felt copy and pasted- not enough variety in the class 
2. Paladins frequently and consistently are out performing other classes. They are "hogging the spotlight".
3. A player wants to build around a modern or atypical paladin fantasy, but the Divine Smite pushes them into the classic paladin look
> #### Encounters Per Day
>
> Divine Smite is a feature that's power is closely tied to the number of encounters the party has in a day. Groups that have 1-2 large encounters a day will tend to find the feature far more powerful than groups expected to go through 3-8 small/medium encounters per long rest. 
>
> Paladins who are already conserving spells for healing as they are expected to go 6+ encounters before a rest need different attention than those going for an encounter or two before resting. Each has a separate expierence with the feature- one finds it entirely useless while the other is nuking enemies left and right. 
>
> Knowing which kind of group you tend to play with can help determine which fix is best for your table. Consider that fix three likely works great at both, while fix 1 and 2 work better with small numbers of encounters per long rest.

To address these core three issues, here are three variations of divine smite to try out instead.
### Quick Fixes

#### Option 1: Nerf Bat
> #### Divine Smite
>
> Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

This fix is the ugliest, but the simplest. It makes the spell versions substantially better comparatively, as even now Searing Smite has the potential to do more damage more consistently. It still has many of the problems the old smite had, but does slightly incentivize using spells to do other things. 

It helps address paladins who are consistently out performing other classes, but not in a way players can be excited about. If you want a quick and easy fix for reeling in a paladin at your table, talk to them about this quick and easy fix. If you want a bit more of an elegant and game impacting change, we can look at some more options:

#### Option 2: Adjusted Action Economy
> #### Divine Smite
>
> Starting at 2nd level, you can channel holy energy into your weapons to smite your foes. As a bonus action on your turn, you can consume a spell slot to imbue radiant damage into a melee weapon. The next time on your turn you hit a creature with the imbued melee weapon you deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 4d8. The damage increases by 2d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

This option brings divine smite into the realm of "fair" mechanics. There is now a risk to using the resource- if you miss, your spell slot did nothing. Notably, this reduces the number of times a character smites on a crit. Having to decide before the roll removes a player’s ability to decide to smite because they crit. This substantially reduces divine smite’s power, but it makes moments where you *do* crit with a smite feel amazing. 

This version shifts some of the damage to make smiting substantially more effective against fiends and undead while just okay against other creatures. This incentivizes players to load of damaging spells (like the spell smites) on regular creatures, and when they run into a fiend or undead you better believe they are excited to pull out their classic divine smite and blast some radiant goodness into the beast.

Players have more reason now to prepare spells to actively improve their combat prowess. *Divine favor* seems better when it takes the same action your smite does and will do more long term, even if you miss your initial attack. Vengeance paladins can consider *hunter's mark* instead, not along side, smite. This moderately improves the fantasy element as well by encouraging more diversity of abilities. Players can craft their own play patterns around a fair spell list instead of falling back on just smiting anything and everything in combat. 

> #### The Other Smites
>
>The comparable level 1 smite spells (*thunderous, searing, wrathful*) all also have an extra condition associated with the resource use- you have to use the resource before you know if you will hit a creature that turn. If you *wrathful smite*, miss, and the encounter ends before your next turn, you've effectively just lost a spell slot for no reason. You likely weren't going to match the original *divine smite*'s damage for a small upside of potentially frightening the creature. 
>
>This feature encourages active use of the other smites against non-undead/fiends and opens up the other smites as your go to damaging spells to prepare for your encounters if you want to spend spell slots on burst damage. It brings the core smite in line with its spell siblings.  

When it comes to player fantasy, though, we still are locked into that traditional idea of a fiend hating undead slayer. We can do better.

#### Option 3: Custom Smiting
> #### Divine Smite 
>
> Starting at 2nd level, choose two of the following creature types: fey, fiend, undead, elemental, aberration, monstrosity, ooze, or celestial. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant. You can choose on additional creature type at 5th and 13th level.
>
> Whenever you a hit a creature of the one of the chosen types, you can choose to deal 2d10 damage of the chosen type to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. This damage improves to 3d10 at 5th level, 4d10 at 9th level, 5d10 at 13th level, and 6d10 at 17th level. 
>
> You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all uses of this feature when you complete a short rest.

This iteration introduces an entirely new resource to paladins that only affects a chosen pairing of enemies. Players can specialize exactly how they want and be at their best when fighting monsters their character most opposes. Evil paladins can smite from the nine hells against fey and celestials while a pure good devotion paladin can still radiantly smite undead and fiends (now better than before!). It forces paladins to construct a meaningful spell list while moving a chunk their moments of awesomeness to specific encounters they are expected to be amazing in. 

This change will most directly impact the table. It clearly defines when your paladins should smite and feel awesome. The player gets to pick that moment, making it way more meaningful and helping players own their character they built. On top of this, paladins will start to feel and appear diverse within their own Oaths- a Vengeance paladin that hunts undead looks way different now than an evil Vengeance paladin hunting Angels. Ones smite is radiant and slays undead and demons while the other targets angels and other outsiders with necrotic or fire damage. 

These smites all look unique- they have their own flavor built right in. They dramatically reduce a paladin's ubiquitous power while still providing a fair chunk of encounters where the paladin can feel awesome. 

 
 ### Closing Thoughts

Divine Smite breaks one of the fundamental rules of combat: actions. It takes no additional action to use. This leaves paladins free to choose when to nuke a monster with a resource they don't have to ever use. This mechanic then discourages paladins from using spells in other ways as that costs them something- a simple comparison to *searing smite* shows you the radically difference in power the two features have.

Having a powerful feature only is an issue when it crowds out other cool and interactive features. Divine Smite tends to be that powerful of a feature compared to what other features paladin has access to.
Paladins shifted away from their roots in this edition. Paladins are now the class the follows a code and draws power from it- their Oath defines them. Paladins can be protectors of life and law (Devotion), guardians of nature (Ancients), or even vengeful hunters (Vengeance). Lay on hands is a feature that will still suffer from this identity shift, but alas we can’t fix all the features in this one article. Perhaps another time.
