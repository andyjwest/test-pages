"The slime crusted walls and occult scrawling would shake any average adventurer- not I! The secret of their strange powers must lie somewhere in these lightless tunnels. No matter how many times I slay them, they always seem to reform with their blank gelatinous faces and amorphous phisiology. All I know is that when I uncover the magical nature and chemistry behind this patron I will be revered for years to-" - Kalimor Kalimorious, wizard extraordinaire as he stumbled into a transparent gelatinous cube.

Warlocks are the best tool box class 5th edition has to offer. The act as the most customizable option in the game. By third level, you have chosen your own Patron, Invocations, Spells, and Pact boon- literally every feature you've obtained has offered customization choices. A huge part of the identity and popularity of the class comes from this customization bit. More importantly, the Otherworldly Patron drives player and DM imagination alike and inspires players to come up with unique and engaging characters.

Designing patrons for whatever purpose asks a lot of the creator. For today’s Brew Bits, we'll break down Otherworldly Patrons in a step by step guide that can help you bring your own Otherworldly Entities to the table in ways the core books just don't support. 

Our warlock otherworldly patron that we'll be using for reference is the Endless Ooze- whether you are a worshiper of Jubilex, demon lord of oozes, or have contacted a plane encompassing hive mind ooze from the outer realms, the Endless Ooze brings the all the fun of the gelatinous cube and black pudding to your Warlocks!

> ## Otherworldly Patron: The Endless Ooze 
> You have made a pact with a sentient otherworldly amorphous entity. These entities vary from hungering endless masses of acid to powerful demon lords looking to bring madness to the material. Jubilex, demon lord of oozes, and Ghaundaur, that which lurks, both serve as powerful entities eager to deal with mortals. You have bargained with this powerful entity to borrow power that changes your physical form to become as mutable as the oozes of the material plane. 
>
> ### Expanded Spell List
> The Endless Ooze lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you leanr a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 

>
|Spell Level| Spells|
|:--:|:--|
|1st| *grease, ray of sickness*|
|2nd| *pass without trace, protection from poison*|
|3rd| *meld into stone, stinking cloud*|
|4th| *control water, stone shape*|
|5th| *contagion, passwall*| 

>
>### Mutable Form
> Starting at 1st level, you adopt your patron's amorphous form. You can use a bonus action to become **amorphous** until the end of your turn. While amorphous, any equipment you are carrying become amorphous with you. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, attacks of opportunity made against you while amorphous are made with disadvantage. 
>
> If you end your turn in a space that you would normally not fit, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are shunted.
>
>### Aspect of the Ooze
>At 6th level, choose one of the following aspects to adopt: 
>
> ***Gelatinous Cube: Transparent.*** As an action, you can mutate your form and any equipment you are carrying, becoming transparent for up to 1 minute. While you are not moving or taking other actions, it takes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you with a DC equal to your Warlock spell save DC + your Constitution modifier. A creature that tries to enter your space while unware of you is surprised by you. 
>
> Once you use this feature, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
> More to come with this option’s official release!
>### Unnatural Constitution
> At 10th level, your patron grants you the resistances and constitution of an ooze. Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. 
>
> In addition, choose two of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold, fire, lightning. Whenever you would take damage of the chosen types, reduce the total damage by 1d10+ your Constitution modifier. 
>
>### Consumption 
> At 14th level, your body can mutate into a full ooze. As an action on your turn, a creature your size or smaller within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC or become engulfed inside you. You grow one size category and become translucent while a creature is engulfed in you.
>
> An engulfed creature takes 8d6 acid damage. It can't breathe, is restrained, and takes an additional 6d6 acid damage at the start of each of your turns.
> 
> An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a Strength check against your Warlock spell save DC+ your Constitution modifier. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you. 
>
> Once you engulf a creature with this feature, you can't do so again until you complete you finish a long rest.

## Feature Breakdown 
Existing warlock patrons tend to follow a pattern- first level is a generic build around ability and expanded spell list, sixth is a defensive feature that helps get you out of sticky situations, tenth is a passive defensive enhancement, and fourteenth is a powerful tool that reflects the flavor of the class in a powerful way. While you don't need to follow this pattern, it’s a pretty good starting guide for creating diverse features for the class option.

It is important to keep in mind a few things. First, Pact Magic gives warlocks frequent access to their spells, but in small doses. Short rest casting is a unique feature to warlocks and can easily feel oppressive if certain spells are introduced to the option or other features are introduced that manipulate their spells. Warlock Invocations provide tremendous amounts of utility as well. Look for overlap with existing invocations and Warlock spells and try to avoid creating features that Warlocks already have access too. 

### Expanded Spell List
The expanded spell list provides new build around tools for warlocks. Being short rest casters mean what few spells they do have will be used frequently and at their highest spell slot. 

Here are the main things to consider when deciding which flavorful spells should go with your patron:

#### How does the spell reflect the flavor of your patron?

This tends to be the most crucial element of a Warlock expanded spell list. Some patrons will have an easy time grabbing spells off other classes spell lists while others can be trickier. Our example emphasizes the sickness and acidic aspect of oozes- they are unhealthy, gelatinous, festering creatures. To reflect their gross and sticky nature, we add spells like *grease, meld into stone, and stone shape* to reflect an oozes natural tendency and give players tools to mess around with it how they want.

#### Can warlocks gain access to this spell outside of the expanded spell list? 

If a spell seems like a home run but can be gained outside adding it in an expanded spell list, I'd avoid it. Spells that are at will invocations are examples of spells I'd avoid putting on the Warlock spell list. Having overlap reduces the total number of options at a player’s disposal. We want to provide as many new ways to play as we can.
The spells *disguise self* and *altar self* work great for an ooze patron- adjusting your form to look different is within the shape changing, amorphous nature oozes bring to the table. Both are accessible within invocations, however. Players who want that aspect of oozes can already get it with invocations, so instead we chose different spells that fit within our patron’s flavor. 

This doesn't mean you can't use flavorful spells on your expanded spell list if they already exist elsewhere in the class. I'd simply advise against it.

#### What kind of play pattern do these spells support? 
 
This is the hardest question to answer. Some spells, when used frequently, shape how game play happens. For our example, *ray of sickness* is a scaling spell that works great with Warlock spell slots. It’s a damaging spell that encourages a ranged caster archetype for the patron while *grease* opens more of a utility route/melee route by knocking enemies prone. 

Spells to avoid would be long duration concentration spells and spells that summon additional creatures. Spells like *animate dead* can become oppressive when used on short rest refreshing spell slots. Consider how a spell would look if a player used it every hour- if the spell starts to function strangely or gives a player more resources than other classes gain from the spell, I'd consider not adding the spell to the expanded spell list. 

### Level 1 Feature
A classes level 1 feature defines a huge portion of a character. Warlocks, Sorcerers and Clerics all have the huge advantage of getting to pick from multiple level 1 features with their subclass choice. A patron shapes the characters play pattern in a huge way- Fiend warlocks getting access to refreshing temporary hit points encourage more reckless, combat centric characters while our Ooze patron's Mutable Form encourages characters to explore otherwise inaccessible areas. 

> ### Mutable Form
> Starting at 1st level, you adopt your patron's amorphous form. You can use a bonus action to become **amorphous** until the end of your turn. While amorphous, you any equipment you are carrying becomes amorphous with you. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, attacks of opportunity made against you while amorphous are made with disadvantage. 
>
> If you end your turn in a space that you would normally not fit, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are shunted.
>

Warlocks are special because of their diversity of play styles. When going into most of the other classes, you have a predetermined idea of what kinds of styles your character will adopt in combat. Warlocks can diversify into full on spell casters in combat, maximizing the power of their cantrips and spell list, or go for a more weapon centric build focused around blade. Having access to shortbows makes ranged *hex* builds with supporting spells and invocations aimed at manipulating combat and flourishing outside of it. 

The means more than anything, a warlock patrons 1st level feature needs to be *flexible.* It needs to work in a variety of builds to embrace the core design premise of the class. I highly encourage designers to steer away from combat centric features that give straight bonuses to acting in a certain way but instead provide tools to expand what warlocks bring to the table. Mutable Form is a great example- I can envision a ranged warlock using the feature to duck in and out of cover, sneaking behind a locked door every turn and popping back out to rain arrows or blasts at their foes as well as builds that have a Warlock in the thick of things with a great sword, maximizing the features ability to navigate in combat without suffering too much damage from attacks of opportunity. 

### Level 6 Feature 
Here we have our first defensive feature. In our example, we use an unconventional tactic for defense: transparency. It does an excellent job of being a defensive tools Ooze-locks can employ when things are getting rough while also being a tool players can employ in creative ways to solve puzzles and navigate the world with. 

The fiend's level six feature is similar- it can be used on both saving throws AND ability checks, making it a defensive tool for when you fail a saving throw in the thick of things but also a feature that can bolster your chances at succeeding on any old ability check. The flexibility of the defensive feature is a great premise to design around. Making a feature players can use in ways outside the norm helps them feel awesome for figuring that out. Mist Escape is another great example- a warlock might prick themselves with a dagger to activate misty escape as just an invisible 60 ft. teleport outside of combat. 

This feature doesn't need to be defensive- if your first level feature encouraged defensive play, consider just adding a tool to the subclasses tool box players can mess around with in a variety of situations in and out of combat that alters the space they are working with. 

I’d recommend at least keeping the feature tied to a number of uses per rest or a feature that lets players take a new action or bonus action. Having more stuff to do at this level is needed when Warlocks are limited in spells per encounter by pact magic. 

The full Endless Ooze patron includes a greater diversity of 6th level features to choose from and will be coming out within a future project that’s currently a WIP. Try to always include diverse features that give players opportunities for customization and self-expression. 

### Level 10 Feature
At 10 warlocks tend to get a boring feature. Passive bonuses don't inherently feel epic, yet they bring a level of epic-ness to the character when effects that hinder the rest of the party fail to affect you. 

With this line of thought, I've presented the most basic iteration of the 10th level feature I'm happy with. What is important to every feature in the game is a sense of ownership. Here, players can pick from a variety of damage types to customize how their body has transformed. It takes on the normal effect of a 10th level feature while still feeling unique to the option. Ooze-locks have a greater constitution than other warlocks tend to have and a feature that supports having a higher Constitution. 

When building your own, consider how to make this passive feel unique and attached to your patron. Basic resistances and condition immunities are the easiest way to present the feature, but I'd seriously encourage digging into niche mechanics. Explore what you can do in the system- adding in dice rolling effects and dice manipulation is a great way to make a passive trait feel alive and unique to your option. 

### Level 14 Feature
Here is the coolest feature to design for your patron. This is your big flashy ability that best represents the patron and their warlocks- it is an awesome tool that players use to tie together the flavor of their subclass with the mechanics of their class. 

Our example shows a powerful feature tied to the most iconic of oozes. A player becoming a large amorphous blob that then devours a smaller creature just feels epic. It deals a fair chunk of damage but most importantly emphasizes the player fantasy that the player has been developing these past 14 levels. 

When building your own, you can build any variety of feature. Ours is similar to Hurl through Hell but modeling yours after Create Thrall can be an equally awesome ability. You can branch out into weirder design space here, too- this is the place for your awesome Warlock features that don’t fit anywhere else.

Anything that has a huge effect on the character that emphasizes the patron fantasy best should go here. By this level, most door ways are open as far as mechanics go- feel free to make a powerful feature to mess around with. You'd rather have a feature that is too strong here than too weak, and it’s okay to slowly real it in over time if it proves to be oppressing other players at the table.
