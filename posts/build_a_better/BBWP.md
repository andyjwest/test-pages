## Brew Bits: Building a Warlock Patron

Your designing a world. Magic is abundant, great powers vie for absolute control over a complex realm. A player approaches your ancient entity of war and wants to strike a deal. "In exchange for your power, war monger, I will do favors for you and help turn the tide of this conflict to your favor!"

So now as a DM you have an issue- how do you mechanically approach this bargain?

Plenty of options exist currently for the Warlock class. Today, we're looking at creating your own to bring your world to life and engage your players in the world around them in more ways than ever before. 

### Warlock Subclasses

Why do we build new Warlock subclasses? For one, they can provide meaningful world implecations and lore elements to a game that the existing patrons don't naturally fulfill. Sure, you can reflavor and edit existing patrons pretty easily to fit your aesthetic. Making your own can be far more engaging and fun for both your and your party.

#### Bring a unique entity into your world 
 
Warlock patrons come with built in role play elements to the game. A fiend patron automatically asserts that there is a fiend out there you borrow power from- this is an entity a player directly interacts with in exchange for mechanical power. 



Introduce new mechanics for selecting already existing monsters as patrons 
Existing include unicorns, archfey, demon lords, devil lords, etc
Can be a specific or general as the world asks for 

Subclass for Warlocks
Defines expanded spell list
Core to short rest mechanics, greatly shapes play pattern 
Opens up warlock builds to focus around specific spells 
Ex: Feylocks and Sleep 



What can we learn from old versions of this topic 
Intent of options gained at various levels 
Play pattern 
Sidebar: See our article all about play patterns behind our paywall!
Level structure- when option expands 
Existing spell list dos and don’ts 
Flavor vs Functionality 
Either can drive the option, but flavor is the core of the class 
Deals with monsters of extraordinary power 
What does the monster want, and what do they ask for in return?
Translating mechanics into flavor
Patron abilities reflected in player abilities 
Opportunity to translate monster mechanics into player mechanics 
Topic specific considerations 
Existing class options “restrict” where we want to expand the option towards
Repeating spells from the warlock spell list, overlap with existing invocations (ex: Silent Image), 
Forcing archtypes 
Can work- better design would be allowing an option to embrace a variety of choices to give players more ways to build the option and more content total to consume 
Bounds of the Warlock class- what should it be good at?
How can this option overstep its bounds and become too good at jobs normally restricted to other classes?
Ex: Blade expansions with multiattack, ample armor and healing utility
Utility and flexibility: the class can do a little bit of everything. 
Consider that it is “stealing” a bit from other classes- stealing a rogue’s stealth, an illusionists illusions, a mages armor, etc. 
What new utility can the option bring to the table that feels like a warlock option that doesn’t outshine a characters other abilities consistently?
Damage builds
How does the class interact with frequent and powerful combat features like hex, agonizing blast, pact of the blade, and pact magic? Do we deviate, or allow for builds to exist? Do we focus more in on defensive and utility tools?
Up to you! Warlock class has lots of room to work within as the classes customizability is the highest in the game 
Constructing an outline
Top 3 reasons to build this option 
Expand the Warlock class mechanically
Bring a role play element from your unique setting to the table 
Provide Warlock players opportunities to satisfy fantasies outside the normal reflavoring of a subclass 
Mechanics you want to include within the option
How does this option function defensively and out of combat
Possibility to add combat play pattern adjustments 
Can cramp player creativity and pigeon hole the option into similar builds every time it comes to the table 
What means of unique defense/utility is it bringing 
Core subclasses all have means of survivability on top of their utility (Fiends temp HP, Feys misty escape, spells that terrify/ damage around self in Old Ones) 
Don’t need to stay within these bounds- interesting to think about
Most importantly: How do these features compound to fulfil player fantasy? How do they work together? Does the play pattern look/feel cohesive to navigate, or is it clunky with too many overlapping actions/concentration slots? 
Implementation
Make three versions of the feature built around your 3 reasons to build and mechanics you want to include
Way more intensive than building smaller features 
How do these iterations work together to form a greater whole?
How does each individual item affect play pattern?
Example: The Endless Ooze 
Outline
Give Warlocks ways to navigate in tight spaces and use oozes abilities in creative ways (Focus on Amorphous feature and Stickiness) 
Bring an Ancient Ooze within the lore to the table in a way players can directly interact with (through NPCs and player option)
Let players embrace old “Ooze Sorcerers” of 3e and play weird wacky alien-ish characters, or just give players ways to play more mad characters 
Implementation
Flavor
Jubilex, “the Ooze Mother” 
Spell List
Level 1 Feature
As an action, can gain the Amorphous trait for up to 1 minute. Refreshes on Short rest/ Cha mod per long rest, or lasts one round at will. 
How this sets up the play pattern out of combat
What builds look like at 3 with this feature 
Sidebar: Variant special familiar for the option 
Level 6
Defensive or expanded utility feature 
Gel coating: similar to Kuo-tao, weapons can stick to you and you can disarm foes this way, ability to abosrb a hit by literally becoming ooze, reaction to become a puddle of ooze
Level 10
Out of combat utility option, or combat option (unsure)
Spider climb at will, but more. Expand level 1 feature (more uses, longer uses)
Level 14


Context
Consider each of your created options against other existing options within and outside the class 
Find 3 game features that share a mechanic and flavor, compare
Compare to  a Warlock, Monk and Cleric subclass 
Monk is flavorful combat heavy short rest class
Cleric is long rest based powerhouse in utility/healing/flexibile builds
Warlock is for a starting point
Closing context 
Final iteration I’d use (also posted up top) 
Key things to keep in mind 
Spell list
Comparative utility
Build diversity
Key thing is players have fun without having the DM to do more work. Subclasses should breed unique pools of similar characters, but not the same play pattern every time. Shape, not define, a play pattern in Warlocks case.
