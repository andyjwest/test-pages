NPCs dedicated Great Old Ones or mad gods tend to share their patorn's goals or overlook them in exchange for power. 
They speak in mad tongues and sew insanity into the people around them. A small hamlet on the outskirts of town with a dedicated temple to maddness might appear normal on the surface, but small quirks and strange mannerisms with the townsfolk can hint at a sinister underlying plot lying in wait. 

The following few tables can help mix and match basic appearances of a follower of Old Gods with significant features and unique traits to set up some basic appearances you can present to your players.

There are other ways to make your NPCs feel like they belong to a cosmic horror setting. Odd expressions and reppedtive speach are two examples. Consider detailed descriptions focused around eccentricities and oddities important NPCs have. A insane mayor might be wearing a tower of worn, patched hats. Perceptive party members might even notice that the stitching on the patches draws shapes, and incredibly perceptive party members could identify those shapes as monstrous faces of creatures unknown to the party.
