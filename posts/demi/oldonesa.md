# World Building with Great Old Ones 
<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeOzo0Axgj0/TPxd8AHkkYI/AAAAAAAABww/GLj3zu2H_b0/s1600/img-hooded_tentacle.jpg">

A crow caws out in the open over the bleak midwinter evening. A cloaked, shaking figure wanders through the snowfall with his bare, bleeding feet leaving red prints in a trail behind him. He is cloaked in a ruined suit, bits and pieces torn around the wrists and ankles with holes made by weapons carved throughout the rest of it. Behind him, in the distance, smoke rises from his latest crime made in the name of the Faceless One. This man either has gone mad and lost all sense of reality or is the only sane one left that sees the future doom racing towards the realm.

5th eddition brought a fun and surpsing twist with the Warlock class when it released. The class was uniquely different from anything the playtest brought before. What came with it was an area of play popular to many RPGs and stories, but moderately unexplored in Dungeons and Dragons: the Great Old Ones. 

These entities add a new dynamic to 5th eddition. Worlds that have a focus around one of these gods to bring out the feel and immersion Great Old Ones lead many players to think about. From *Call of Cthulu* to N'zoth and C'thun of World of Warcraft, DMs have a huge array of tools to bring a unique feeling to the table when dealing with Old Gods and the madness that is tied so closely to them.

This guide aims at giving DMs and Players new tools for roleplaying in these environments as well as general advice for playing games with a Madness or Old God feel to them. 

## Player Options
Players who set forth into a world where an all powerful entity readies to devour all existance might want tools to match this epic theme. Here we present to main ways to embrace the play style: Madness Domain (a redux of Trickery) and alterante Warlock familiars more fit for an incomprehenislbe elder entity. 

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=138kreWGwguUcveB6jrpmPingq77VsA7m) are the options, presented in a printer friendly PDF form. 

## World Building
Worlds riddled with mad prophets and elder gods playing with mortals for entertainment are also full of adventure. Mad cults worshipping these evil entities spring up and threaten the entire surrounding environment with their horrific rituals and sacrifices. Old, abandoned churches can find new life in the hands of mad clerics and priests, praying to gods of insanity that give brilliance along side it. 

The key idea we are going to be focusing on from here on out is the concept of cosmic horror. These ideas stem from my own understanding of pop culture views of great old ones and the genre surrounding their founding stories. 

> ### The Cosmic Horror Contrast
>
> DnD presents the party as heroic actors taking action and shaping the world around them. These PCs matter. Their decisions shape the world and move action. They might even make powerful entites consider them on the Cosmic level.
>
> Cosmic horror stories tend to focus on human insignificance, and can be a great tool to combat the players at the table. The party stands firm that the races of the realm matter in the cosmic scheme of things while the opposition of elder gods and insanity focus instead around the chaotic nature of the universe and the insignficance the party holds. 
>
> It becomes up to the party to prove the entire genre wrong. They must stand up and *matter*. The world literally revolves around them, and they must prove it against the odds when combating the massive horrors that come with insanity and great old ones working only to prove how little the rest of the multiverse matters.


### Environments 
Like many horror settings, cosmic horror stems from subtle alterations to reality but also extends to incomprehensible visions and locatiosn of pure insanity. Setting up players with vivid descriptions can set expectations for the feel and approach they are looking towards when moving foward. When making settings around Great Old Ones, consider focusing in on pop culture views of the genre like tentacle imagery and unsettling images. 

A focus on cosmic scale can help set the mood in these environments. An environments depcition of stellar maps and astronomical devices can set up the otherwordly appearance that goes along side these monsters. 

#### Environmental Effects 
Much like how powerful monsters shape the environment they live, followers and temples to great old ones can shape the physical landscape. Here is a quick table with some ideas on how a well established cult or monster dedicated to eldritch gods might change the world around them.

#### General Stuctures 
Worlds built around these concepts rarely are freindly. Monsters from outside the bounds of reality don't often give friendly aid. Structures built for these entites can look wildly diverse. Some might be simple churches that have small inconsistancies that reveal a hidden secret happening below the surface, while another might be a massive stone obelisk coated in unknown runes along side images depicting the coming old one and its victory over the plane. 

Because of this huge variety, any structure can easily become dedicated to a Great Old One. The following table will focus on descriptive elements you can incorporate into any old building to make lock in further the importance of a Great Old One in the area.

There are some structures that are unique to madness and great old ones however. These places can act as excellent places of worship for your Old Gods or places that simply deal frequently with warlocks and clerics working in the realm of maddness.

#### Dungeons
Dungeons dedicated to Great Old Ones or other mad entities can look quite different from the typcial dungeon. From sacrifical chambers to otherworldly ritual chambers, the rooms you choose to include in your dungeons around these beings can lead to a stand out dungeon that feels like it belongs in a greater story. Regular rooms, like mess halls and barracks, could look entirely different when dedicated to servants of Great Old Ones. 

|d8|Dungeon Room|Descriptive Elements|
|:--:|:--|:--|
|1| Sacrifical Chamber|Dim blue light, stone occult decorations on a stone sacricial slab, tentacle images and statues throughout the room
|2| Mad Library|Warped and rotting wood shelves, living eyes afixed to book covers, no clear organization, text written in multiple seemingly random languages at once, occult symbols and incomprehensible gibberish written over regular text 
|3| Animal Pens|Dead animals stitched together with other animal parts, living abominations composed of humanoid/beast parts, spiked gates with tooth and bat like fixtures|
|4| Barracks/Bunks| Simple, near empty, possessions all seem to be coated in scratches and drawings, blood stained sheets
|5| Dining Hall| Aquatic ornaments decorating benches and chairs, centerpieces all strange occult objects and statues, single dim light source in the center of the table, squid/fish like monsters disguised as food on table 
|6| Ritual Chamber| Bizzare rune circles, focal point around single figure in center, walls and tables covered in alchemical supplies and strange spell components
|7| Dedication Chamber|
|8| Prison|

How you frame dungeon exploration also plays a pivotal role. A focus on light, temperature, and atmosphere are pivital when creating an immersive expierence. The walls of these dungeons could be slimy stone or literally feel like the slimy interior of a living being. Perhaps torches barely function and magical light and darkvsion cease functioning entirely. These kinds of challenges are aimed at showing the party how small they are as well as present so much of the dungeon as unknown. This once again will tie into our goal of approaching cosmic horror within D&D. Hazzards and monsters in these dungeons likely want to show players how small they are comapred to the universe, and how insermountably powerful their foes are. 

More so even though than dungeons the adventuring environment surrounding the players can best shape the feel of the game. Below are some ideas for environmental effects that shape how players act while within an area affected by a Great Old One, a powerful monster of insanity, or some mix of the two. 

While with 5 miles of a Great Old One or a major cult/monster dedicated to it, one of the following effects occurs:

|d6| Environmental Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|1| Light dims no matter what time of day it is. A thin mist always seems to abscure the sun and light.The environment is always considered to be dim light or darkness unless a magical or non-magical source creates bright light. 
|2| Distances always seem to be warped as if an unnautral curvature is subtly shifting the horizon. Whenever a character makes a Survival, Investigation or Perception check when exploring the environment, roll a d4. If the result is a 1, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened by a horrific visage the environment appeared to form in their mind until the start of their next turn and suffers 1d4 pyschic damage. 
|3| Magical heavy rain and dark clouds envelope the landscape and heavily obscure vision. Lightning always seems to reveal some enormous visage above the clouds, but no physical entity is up there. 
|4| All plant life seems to be bending and growing away from a central point. Animals can frequently be seen fleeing directly away from this point.
|5| Disease and plagues run rampant. These strange viruses and bacteria lead to strange, aquatic deformities with people showing symptoms of extra eyes, scales, and tiny tentacles growing in strange places. Whenever a character completes a long rest while in the environment, roll a percentile die. On a result of 5 or below, the character has grown one of these unnatural deformities. 
|6| Regular people spontaneously burst out in strange habits rythmically throughout the day, in song, prophecy of doom, or some other form of distrubing insanity. Whenever a character finishes a long rest while within the area, roll a d20. If the result is 5 or below, every 2d4 hours after finishing the rest until they finish another long rest, the character will have one of these random outbursts, lasting 1 round and otherwise incapacititating the character with no memory of the outburst after. 


#### Closing Thoughts
Cosmic Horror and Great Old Ones can be a great change of pace from a regular D&D game. They can act both as the driving force behind a huge story arch as well as a small side quest to distract players from the standard fantasy world they have been used to exploring.
