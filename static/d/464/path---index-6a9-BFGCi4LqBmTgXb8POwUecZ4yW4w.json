The class was uniquely different from anything else from the playtest. It brought a popular theme from RPGs and stories that was unexplored in Dungeons and Dragons: the Great Old Ones.\n\nThese entities add a new dynamic to 5th edition. Worlds that have a focus around one of these elder gods look closer to a Lovecraft novel and less like a classic Conan fantasy. From the iconic *Call of Cthulhu* to N'zoth and C'thun of World of Warcraft, DMs have a huge array of tools to draw inspiration from in order to bring a unique feeling to the table when dealing with Old Gods and the madness that is so often closely tied to them.\n\nThis guide aims at giving DMs and Players new tools for roleplaying in these environments as well as general advice for playing games with a madness or “Old God” feel to them.\n\n## Player Options\nPlayers who enter a world where an all powerful entity readies to devour all existence might want tools to match this epic theme. Here we present two main ways to embrace the play style: Madness Domain (a redux of Trickery) and alternate Warlock familiars more fit for an incomprehensible elder entity.\n\n[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=138kreWGwguUcveB6jrpmPingq77VsA7m) are the options, presented in a printer friendly PDF form.\n\nNow on to inescapable doom!\n\n## World Building\nWorlds riddled with mad prophets and elder gods playing with mortals for entertainment are also full of adventure. Mad cults worshipping these evil entities spring up and threaten the entire surrounding environment with their horrific rituals and sacrifices. Old, abandoned churches can find new life in the hands of mad clerics and priests eagerly praying to gods of insanity that grant otherworldly strength.\n\nThe key idea we are going to be focusing on from here on out is the concept of **cosmic horror**. The following advice and ideas stem from my own understanding of pop culture views of the Great Old Ones and the genre surrounding their founding stories. I am by no means an expert in the genre but rather a casual observer. These scenes and ideas are drawn from  a variety of popular works.I would encourage anyone looking to delve deeper into the genre to seek out  Lovecraftian-style literature; cult classic horror movies such as IT or the Thing; or video games like Darkest Dungeon’s DLC, the Color of Madness.\n\n> ### The Cosmic Horror Contrast\n>\n> DnD presents the party as heroic actors taking action and shaping the world around them. These PCs matter. Their decisions change the universe and might even make powerful entities consider them on the cosmic level.\n>\n> Cosmic horror stories tend to focus on human insignificance and can be a great tool to combat the players at the table. The party stands firm that the races of the realm matter in the cosmic scheme of things while the opposition of elder gods and insanity focus instead around the chaotic nature of the universe and the insignificance the party holds.\n>\n> It thusly becomes up to the party to prove the genre wrong. They must stand up and *matter*. The world literally revolves around them. They must prove it, against  all odds, when combating the massive horrors that come with insanity and great old ones working only to prove the insignificance of any one individual in the multiverse. \n\n\n### Environments\nLike many horror settings, cosmic horror stems from subtle alterations to reality but also extends to incomprehensible visions and locations of pure insanity. Setting up players with vivid descriptions can set expectations for the feel and approach they are looking toward when moving forward. When making settings based around Great Old Ones, consider focusing in on pop culture views of the genre. Common descriptions include slimy, glistening surfaces;  wild and unnerving shifts in expression and mood; and dreary colors that don’t naturally belong. \n\nA focus on cosmic scale can help set the mood in these environments. An environment’s depiction of stellar maps and astronomical devices can set up the otherworldly appearance that  compliments the Great Old Ones and their monstrous followers. \n\n#### Descriptions\nWhen setting the stage for a cosmic horror style adventure, consider using some of the following words to embellish your environment. Before jumping in with your players, consider how to apply these words to your specific environment. What might this calm farmstead look like after months of rain? A festival ground can be quite disturbing when the life and fun has drained and only dismal passerbys populate its area. \n\nThese two tables should provide some extra adjectives to help immerse players in a world tormented by Eldritch evils. \n\n|d10| Environment Descriptor|\n|:--:|:--|\n|1| dismal \n|2| depressing \n|3| gloomy \n|4| bleak\n|5|  glistening\n|6| sodden\n|7| sullied\n|8| in disrepair \n|9| revolting\n|10| maddening\n\n|d10| Character Feature Descriptor \n|:--:|:--|\n|1|  outcasted\n|2| depressed \n|3| fearful \n|4|  convulsing\n|5| blank expression \n|6| gibbering \n|7| traumatized \n|8| twitching \n|9| hopeless\n|10| hysterical \n\n#### General Atmosphere\nWorlds full of cosmic horror can look any number of ways. Monsters from outside the bounds of reality don't often give friendly aid, and the environment the inhabitants live in tends to suffer. Structures built for these extraplanar entities can look wildly diverse. Some might be simple churches that have small inconsistencies that hint at horrible secrets happening below the surface while another might be a massive stone obelisk coated in unknown runes along side images depicting a writhing monster of tentacles and mind bending patterns.\n\nWhen describing your environments, start small. Cosmic horror melds well with mystery. The unknown is its own character that is always lurking at the edge of scene. Players should frequently be growing more concerned and suspicious of the ordinary. As one puzzle is solved, it reveals three more that have been hidden in plain sight all along. All eventually will point to our big bad but ease into it to aid in the feel of cosmic horror.  \n\nThe following tables give some ideas, descriptive elements, and objects that you can incorporate into any old environment to reinforce the impending doom the party faces. These descriptors are broken down into three categories based on how deep into the mystery the party is: “everything is basically fine”, “wait, what’s that?”, and “oh shit we’re all totally going to die-- horribly!”.\n\n|d6| Everything is Basically Fine|\n|:--:|:--|\n|1| A painting of a young man and woman who gaze into the stars, but the stars all are neon green\n|2| A building with its windows being repaired and some loose teeth scattered outside the door.\n|3| All the structures face a single statue in the center of town\n|4| Animals are nearly absent, and those that do appear are seen fleeing the area or stressed.\n|5| Townsfolk often whisper to each other about the party. When noticed, they’ll swiftly break apart and act as if they didn’t.\n|6| There is a mysterious absence of a common item in town, such as chairs or spoons.\n\n|d6| Wait, What’s That?|\n|:--:|:--|\n|1| A portrait of a well-known character has gradually lost their skin, revealing a grinning mass of discolored tissue\n|2| Mad writing is scrawled in the mud of a recent murder scene \n|3| A bright green star rapidly approaches from the sky. \n|4| The main NPC dies mysteriously after revealing a secret. \n|5| After waking up, the party finds a once occupied area entirely vacant. \n|6| Inhuman footprints lead into a generally respected building. \n\n|d6| Oh Shit We’re All Going to Die -- Horribly!|\n|:--:|:--|\n|1| A  horrifically deformed, heavily wounded body is found close by\n|2| A massive monster breaks through the ground and screams out a prophecy depicting this world’s end. \n|3| The sky turns black and an acidic rain begins to destroy the environment. \n|4| A massive shadow rises from the horizon. It is an eldritch horror of gargantuan scale\n|5| The NPCs all lose their individuality and begin chanting in unison \n|6| The statue in the center of the town has fully transformed into a hideous mound of tentacles and corpses \n\n### Structures and Dungeons \n\nHere we delve into genre specific additions. These structures, environments, and dungeons tie in directly with a cosmic horror plot. \n\n|d6| Location|\n|:--:|:--|\n|1| The crash site of a strange object from space \n|2| A mysterious ziggurat, once abandoned, now fires a purple beam into the sky at night \n|3| Strange circles cut into the landscape depicting unknown runes have led to an academic expedition camping out there \n|4| An insane asylum where characters continue to vanish then reappear more mad than before\n|5| A goblin encampment in the sewers dedicated to strange idols and a fixation with cleanliness \n|6| Two identical onyx sculptures fixed atop two mountains in the same range\n\nThese example locations can act as a great beginning point even if you don’t have a long term plot in mind. Often, players’ imagination will push them into crazy conspiracy theories  that can in turn can inspire your plot development down the road. \n\n#### Designing Dungeons \n\nTime for some dungeon interior decoration! From sacrificial chambers to otherworldly ritual chambers, the rooms you choose to include in your dungeons around eldritch monsters can lead to a stand-out dungeon that feels like it belongs in a greater story. Regular rooms, like mess halls and barracks, could look entirely different when dedicated to servants of Great Old Ones. \n\n|d8|Dungeon Room|Descriptive Elements|\n|:--:|:--|:--|\n|1| Sacrificial Chamber|ominous persistent blue light, stone occult decorations on a stone sacrificial slab, tentacle images and statues throughout the room\n|2| Mad Library|Warped and rotting wood shelves, living eyes affixed to book covers, no clear organization, text written in multiple seemingly random languages at once, occult symbols and incomprehensible gibberish written over regular text\n|3| Animal Pens| Glass tubes containing roiling sludge that seems to crawl closer as its watched, dissected squid like creatures twitching on lab tables, journals showing unknown monsters with scientific notes\n|4| Barracks/Bunks| Simple, near empty, possessions all seem to be coated in scratches and drawings, vomit stained sheets\n|5| Dining Hall| Aquatic ornaments decorating benches and chairs, centerpieces all strange occult objects and statues, single dim light source in the center of the table, squid/fish like monsters disguised as food on table\n|6| Ritual Chamber| Bizzare rune circles, focal point around single figure in center, walls and tables covered in alchemical supplies and strange spell components\n|7| Observatory| Old damaged telescopes and worn charts cover tables, a magnificent crystal ball shows the vastness of the Astral Plane, a mix of religious and scientific instruments |\n|8| Extraplanar Chamber| Empty and airless, hissing sounds and disfigured abominations visible in the distance, a lone, floating door in a seemingly random location in the emptiness|\n\nHow you frame dungeon exploration also plays a pivotal role. A focus on light, temperature, and atmosphere are crucial to creating an immersive experience. Stone walls feel slimy and/or like the interior of a living being. Torches might barely function and magical light and darkvision cease functioning entirely. Patterns can clearly be recognized in the strangest placese but don’t obviously reveal the sinister truth the dungeon protects. \n\nThese kinds of challenges are aimed at showing the party how small they are as well as present so much of the dungeon as unknown. This will tie into our goal of approaching cosmic horror within D&D. Hazards and monsters in these dungeons are out to prove player insignificance.\n\n#### Closing Thoughts\nCosmic Horror and Great Old Ones can be a great change of pace from a regular D&D game. They can act both as the driving force behind a huge story arc as well as a small side quest to distract players from the standard fantasy world they have been used to exploring.\n\nShare with us your thought about the Great Old Ones in D&D- do they not fit well in your worlds?

They act as the most customizable option in the game. By third level, you have chosen your own Patron, Invocations, Spells, and Pact boon. Every feature you've obtained has offered customization choices. A huge part of the identity and popularity of the class comes from this customization. More importantly, the Otherworldly Patron drives player and DM imagination alike and inspires players to come up with unique and engaging characters.\n\nDesigning patrons for whatever purpose asks a lot of the creator. For today’s Brew Bits, we'll break down Otherworldly Patrons in a step by step guide that can help you bring your own Otherworldly Entities to the table in ways the core books just don't support. This is part 1 of a 2 part series, and we'll be covering mainly the first level feature and expanded spell list here to give designers ideas to get their patrons under way. \n\nOur warlock otherworldly patron that we'll be using for reference is the Endless Ooze. Whether you are a worshiper of Jubilex, demon lord of oozes, or have contacted a plane encompassing hive mind ooze from the outer realms, the Endless Ooze brings the all the fun of the gelatinous cube and black pudding to your Warlocks!\n\n[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RZ0XZ271P1mh7Fmj7OSErrUquVDrSnCy) is the printer-friendly PDF file for those looking for an easy print and play!\n\n> ## Otherworldly Patron: The Endless Ooze \n> You have made a pact with a sentient otherworldly amorphous entity. These entities vary from hungering endless masses of acid to powerful demon lords looking to bring madness to the material. Jubilex, demon lord of oozes, and Ghaundaur, That Which Lurks, both serve as powerful entities eager to deal with mortals. You bargained with a powerful entity to borrow power that changes your physical form to become as mutable as an ooze. \n>\n> ### Expanded Spell List\n> The Endless Ooze lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. \n\n\n|Spell Level| Spells|\n|:--:|:--|\n|1st| *grease, ray of sickness*|\n|2nd| *pass without trace, protection from poison*|\n|3rd| *meld into stone, stinking cloud*|\n|4th| *control water, stone shape*|\n|5th| *contagion, passwall*| \n\n\n>### Mutable Form\n> Starting at 1st level, you borrow the ability to assume your patron's amorphous form. You can use a bonus action to become **amorphous** until the end of the turn. While amorphous, any equipment you are carrying become amorphous with you. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, attacks of opportunity made against you while amorphous are made with disadvantage. \n>\n> If you end your turn in a space that you would normally not fit, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are shunted.\n>\n>### Aspect of the Ooze\n>At 6th level, choose one of the following aspects to adopt: \n>\n> ***Gelatinous Cube: Transparent.*** As an action, you can mutate your form and any equipment you are carrying, becoming transparent for up to 1 minute. While you are not moving or taking other actions, it takes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you with a DC equal to your Warlock spell save DC + your Constitution modifier. A creature that tries to enter your space while unware of you is surprised by you. \n>\n> Once you use this feature, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.\n> \n> ##### Look out for the full option in an upcoming release with additional level 6 features!\n>\n>### Unnatural Constitution\n> At 10th level, your patron grants you the resistances and constitution of an ooze. Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. \n>\n> In addition, choose two of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold, fire, lightning. As a reaction to taking damage of the chosen type, you can reduce the total damage by 1d10+ your Constitution modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all expended uses upon completing a long rest.\n>\n>### Consumption \n> At 14th level, your body can mutate into a full ooze. As an action on your turn, a creature your size or smaller within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC or become engulfed inside you. You grow one size category and become translucent while a creature is engulfed in you.\n>\n> An engulfed creature takes 6d6 acid damage. It can't breathe, is restrained, and takes an additional 6d6 acid damage at the start of each of your turns.\n> \n> An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a Strength check against your Warlock spell save DC+ your Constitution modifier. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you. \n>\n> Once you engulf a creature with this feature, you can't do so again until you complete you finish a long rest.\n\n## Feature Breakdown \nExisting warlock patrons tend to be built using the following design pattern.\n\n|Warlock Level| Type of Feature| \n|:--:|:--|\n|1st| A generic build around ability and an expanded spell list.\n|6th| A defensive feature that helps get you out of sticky situations.\n|10th| A passive defensive enhancement.\n|14th| A powerful tool that reflects the flavor of the class in a powerful way. \n\nWhile it isn't neccisary to follow this pattern, it’s a great starting guide for creating diverse Warlock features. I would encourage designers to at least include an expanded Warlock spell list at  to help define both the option's flavor and mechanics.\n\nThere are a two core features that help provide context for desinging Warlock patrons. \n\nPact Magic gives warlocks frequent access to their spells, but in small doses. Short rest casting is a unique feature to warlocks and can easily feel oppressive if features are introduced that manipulate their Pact Magic spells. \n\nEldritch Invocations provide tremendous amounts of utility to the class. Look for overlap with existing invocations and Warlock spells and try to avoid creating features that Warlocks already have access too. This design choice can expand player options by giving them more tools to tinker around with when character building. \n\n### Expanded Spell List\nThe expanded spell list provides new build around tools for warlocks and shouldn't be overlooked. Being short rest casters means what few spells a Warlock knows can be a major part of their play pattern. Ideally, an expanded Warlock spell list opens up entirely new play patterns to Warlocks without neccisarily crossing into other classes' areas of expertise.\n\nHere are the three questions to consider when deciding which spells should go in an expanded spell list.\n\n#### How does the spell reflect the flavor of your patron?\n\nThis tends to be the most crucial element of a Warlock expanded spell list. Some patrons will have an easy time grabbing spells off other classes spell lists while others can be trickier. Our example emphasizes the stickiness and acidic aspect of oozes- they are unhealthy, gelatinous, festering creatures. To reflect their nature, we add spells like *grease, meld into stone,* and *stone shape* to reflect an oozes anatomy and give players ways to feel ooze-like.\n\n#### Can warlocks gain access to this spell outside of the expanded spell list? \n\nIf a spell seems like a home run but can be gained outside adding it in an expanded spell list, I'd avoid it. Spells that are at will invocations are examples of spells I'd avoid putting on the Warlock spell list. Having overlap reduces the total number of options at a player’s disposal. We want to provide as many new ways to play as we can.\n\nThe spells *disguise self* and *altar self* work great for an ooze patron- adjusting your form to look different is within the shape changing, amorphous nature oozes bring to the table. Both are accessible within invocations, however. Players who want that aspect of oozes can already get it with invocations, so instead we chose different spells that fit within our patron’s flavor. This doesn't close off ways to play Ooze-locks but rewards players who really want to go all out in their thematic elements within the base invocation list.\n\nThis doesn't mean you *can't* use flavorful spells on your expanded spell list if they already exist elsewhere in the class. I'd simply advise against it.\n\n#### What kind of play pattern do these spells support? \n \nThis is the hardest question to answer. Some spells, when used frequently, shape how game play happens. For our example, *ray of sickness* is a scaling spell that works great with Warlock spell slots. It’s a damaging spell that encourages a ranged caster archetype for the patron while *grease* opens more of a utility/melee route by knocking enemies prone and controlling an area. \n\nSpells to avoid would be long duration concentration spells and spells that summon additional creatures. Spells like *animate dead* can become oppressive when used on short rest refreshing spell slots. Consider how a spell would look if a player used it every hour- if the spell starts to function strangely or gives a player more resources than other classes gain from the spell, I'd consider not adding the spell to the expanded spell list. \n\nWe want to encourage frequent use of these spells, but only in a way that doesn't push out other players from interacting in the world. If a warlocks army of animated zombies can plow through most traps and encounters, its detracting from other players problem solving opportunties and forcing the DM to build around a single particularly oppressive feature. \n\n### Level 1 Feature\nA classes level 1 feature defines a huge portion of a character. Fiend warlocks have access to refreshing temporary hit points which encourages a reckless, combat centric character. Our Ooze patron's Mutable Form encourages characters to explore otherwise inaccessible areas and deftly dodge in and out of melee combat.\n\nThe 1st level feature can be hugely diverse thanks to the other avalible choices within the Warlock class.\n\nWarlocks are special because of their diversity of play styles. When creating a character from a different class, there is a predetermined idea of what kinds of styles the character will adopt in combat. Warlocks can diversify into full on spell casters in combat, maximizing the power of their cantrips and spell list. They could instead go for a more weapon centric build focused around Pact of the Blade and temporary hit points. Having access to shortbows makes ranged *hex* builds with supporting spells and invocations aimed at manipulating combat and flourishing outside of it. All of these basic examples show how diverse the class can be.\n\nConsider one of the following approaches when designing a first level feature. These approaches overlap each other, but each has a set approach to appeal to different players. \n\n#### Flexibility\n\nFlexible features work in a variety of builds and are a gateway for players to build in a variety of ways. Mutable Form is an example of a flexible feature. Its bonuses in and out of combat give Ooze-locks a set of tools to build around or with. Players can take the option in a variety of directions. They can take melee centric spells to build a character that thrives in the thick of things. Alternately, they can focus more on infiltration and deception abilities to boost its exploration and role play potential. The option isn't limited to these two paths, either. Creativity can drive players to work the feature into a the play styles that suits them best.\n\nFlexbile features don't reward a player for doing exactly one thing but instead give players a feature they can fiddle with. These often will be at will abilities that have powerful uses in and out of combat. Flexible features tend to fit somewhere in a play pattern but aren't always the #1 action or bonus action the player is looking to take. Cunning Action is a great example of flexible feature outside of Warlock.\n\n#### Toolbox \nA toolbox feature focuses around giving players a unique and powerful tool to engage their environment with. The Fey feature, Fey Presence, is a great example of this. It has the potential to shift an encounter from loss to victory or be used as a get out of jail free type effect when the party is in a sticky situation. It can't be repeatidly used, nor be entirely built around, but instead gives a player a powerful tool to use when needed. \n\nToolbox features tend to be limited in uses. Warlocks refresh the bulk of their power upon completing a short rest, but this doesn't mean you absolutely have to limit toolbox style features to once per short rest. Features like a Light cleric's Warding Flare can make excellent toolbox features and can be an excellent fit for a first level warlock feature. \n\nThese shouldn't always be 100% effective. When toolbox features are tuned a bit too high, they can circumnavigate prepared encounters frequently and easily. Instead, look to push toolbox features towards being powerful in specific circumstances and just okay in most scenarios. As the name suggests, a toolbox feature can be one of many tools a warlock would turn towards to attack a specific problem.\n\n\n#### Build Around \nBuild around features focus primarily on in or out of combat play patterns. The last two PHB options give us great examples of each. Dark One's Blessing is a powerful build around feature for encounters while Awakened Mind is an excellent build around feature for exploration based characters.\n\nThe core of a build around feature is a powerful effect that can be improved. Dark One's Blessing, for example, rewards players by having them deal more damage. The more creatures they down, the more temporary hit points they recieve. In addition, in order to maximize these hit points, the fiend-lock is encouraged to be in the thick of things or at least take some damage so they can continue to refresh the pool. \n\nAlterantely, Awakened Mind wants a player to communicate telepathically with characters outside of combat. This encourages mental manipulation and negotiating. It acts as a shared language as well as a form of silent communication in role play environments as well as a tool for setting up ambushes silently with the party. It can easily be built around with supporting abilities that improve your Charisma skills or mess with a creatures mind. \n\nConsider what supplemental features can improve a build around feature. How well supported is a particular play style? Dark One's Blessing is supproted well with invocations like Armor of Shadows and the Pact of the Blade Pact Boon. Pact of the Chain supports Awakened Mind along side invocations like Misty Visions and Eyes of the Rune Keeper. Players can actively build towards a core theme, and at its center is the build around feature. \n\nBuild around features typically have unlimited uses and are \"always on\". A player is looking to frequently take advantage of the feature and actively be using it in a wide array of environments to interact with the world. \n\n\n### Closing Thoughts\nDon't worry, more is coming soon on building Warlock patrons. This starting point can be all you need to build your own with a little creativity. \n\nWhat Warlock Otherworldly Patron have you been itching to see at the table?

As he reaches for the roses, smiling and laughing, a dagger wreathed in flames with a demonic eye in the handle appears from thin air in her off-hand. The ambassador didn’t have time to gasp before his throat was slit open, and the jester vanished into thin air. \n\nOne of the most popular ways to play the Warlock class is building around the Pact of the Blade feature. The fantasy is incredible. A character is gifted a weapon from their Otherworldly Patron: a dagger from the nine hells, a rapier from a fey queen, a trident from a kraken god. All of these promise a fantasy that largely leaves players feeling underwhelmed once they use it in practice. With the right context and expectations, I believe the feature can deliver without needing to look outside the Player’s Handbook. Today we're going over how to get the most out of Warlock Pact of the Blade!\n\n## Feature Breakdown: Pact of the Blade\n\n> ### Pact of the Blade\n>You can use your *action* to **create** a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this **melee** weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon **counts as magical** for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.\n>\n>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\n>\n>You can transform one Magic Weapon into your pact weapon by performing a Special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears **whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter**. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\n>\n\nAt its core, pact of the blade is a utility feature, not a combat feature. Gaining a weapon from your patron implies its use in combat. In practice it just tends to act as an expanded proficiency boost into martial weapons normally with only a 1-3 point difference in average damage. The feature itself doesn't provide any huge boosts in early combat. The magical property does come in handy with specific enemies, but isn’t the core power the feature brings. \n\nPact of the Blade provides players with a huge toolbox of weapons to call to their side at will. Players don't have a single weapon forged by their patron but instead an armory of weapons ready to be summoned. This means you are never unarmed, have no trouble hiding your weapons, and can mix up what weapons you bring each time you summon one. A bladelock never needs to worry about having an incriminating weapon on them that would tie them to the scene of a crime, and could even frame another by selecting an unusual weapon tied to the character!\n\nThe feature does not specify that the weapon must come from the base weapon table in the equipment section of the book. With DM permission, this opens up your options into exotic territories as well that can have a major impact both in and out of combat. You are proficient in any weapon you conjure including martial and exotic weapons, so get creative!\n\nBelow is a list of weapons the increase your ability to influence the world in and out of combat from the PHB equipment table.\n\n##### Utility Pack Weapons\n|Weapon| Damage| Properties|\n|:--|:--:|:--|\n|Dagger| d4 piercing| Finesse, light, thrown (20/60), **aquatic**|\n|Handaxe| d6 slashing| Light, thrown (20/60)|\n|Glaive| d10 slashing| Heavy, two-handed, reach|\n|Trident| d6 piercing| Thrown (20/60), versatile (d8), **aquatic**|\n|Whip| d4 piercing| Finesse, reach|\n|Lance| d12 piercing| Reach, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made against creatures within 5 feet of you, two-handed (while unmounted)|\n\nThis list supports a huge array of builds but also can slot into many existing builds. Need to break an object far away? Conjure a throwing hammer and break smash it at a distance! Need a 10 foot long rope on the fly? A whip is your best friend! Find yourself shipwrecked and doing battle with merrow? Grab a trident and fight with ease! You can summon an axe to cut down trees and a warpick to clear the caved in entrance to the dungeon.\n\n> #### The Aquatic Weapon Property\n>\n> The **aquatic** weapon property is a new weapon property coming in next month's Hotfix, focusing on Underwater combat.\n> \n\n\n## Ability Scores\n\nPact of the Blade's flexibility encourages two core ability scores: Strength and Dexterity. Charisma is the recommended as the go to stat for Warlocks but isn’t as neccisary for Pact of the Blade Warlocks. By prioritizing spells that don’t require spell attack rolls or saves, bladelocks can juice their combat focused stats to increase their damage output and survivability. Spells like *hex*, *friends*, *mage hand*, *armor of agathys*, and *invisibility* all don’t interact with your spell attack bonus or spell save DC at all while supporting melee and utility focused characters. Having a few spells that still require these attributes isn’t awful, but will require a bit more planning and setup to find the most success with these features. \n\nDexterity as a primary stat opens the most doors for bladelocks. It boosts your AC, ranged weapon attacks and damage, and melee finesse weapon attacks and damage. Shortbows are simple weapons. Picking one up opens up your character to also having a decent ranged option, and a pair of shortswords can deal solid damage in the early levels when paired with *hex*. \n\nAlternately, focusing more on Strength and Constitution gives you a more “tanky” warlock. Greatswords hit like a truck, and you can swap between any number of weapons to get the job done. Need an open hand? Grab a longsword! Something resistant to slashing damage? Time for a maul! Prioritizing these two stats with Dexterity as your third produces a beefy character. Add onto that any of the ample temporary hit point effects within the class or AC boosts and you can get away with an even lower Dexterity if you would rather take a decent Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma. \n\n## Supporting Features\nBy itself, Pact of the Blade can be an excellent supplemental feature to other core builds. Its similar to the Conjuration Wizard's *Minor Conjuration* feature with a bit more limitation. That on its own can be hugely valuable to Warlocks with Dexterity or Strength as their highest or second highest ability score.\n\nWhat if you want to build around a specific weapon, though? If you have the desire to take a warped fiendish greatsword into battle, you can pick up a few warlock spells/invocations to push the power of your weapon up a notch.\n\n### Hex\nHex is the single spell I'd recommend to every Warlock looking for consistent damage. It is similar to Sneak Attack. In specific builds, early on it can outperform that feature when two weapon fighting is employed. Any bladelock worth their salt should pick up Hex if they are looking to navigate combat and want to dish out a comparably fair amount of damage with rogues and paladins.\n\nThis spell can be built upon along side Pact of the Blade. If you take the Two Weapon Fighting feat, you can conjure a rapier in your main hand and draw a short sword for the highest damage two-weapon fighting build out there. With *hex* adding a bonus d6 damage on marked targets, you'll be dealing 1-2d6 bonus damage a round on top of regular weapon damage.\n\nEven for non two-weapon fighting builds, bringing a 2d6+4 greatsword damage to 3d6+4 is substantial. It additionally can free up your bonus action slot a bit more, giving your more flexibility in combat.\n\nMoving your hex around can require some planning and group coordination to maximize its effectiveness, and often you'll find yourself tackling a single huge enemy while your allies deal with their hordes of underlings so you can get the most out of your actions. This is particularly noticeable in two-weapon fighting builds where you are juggling your off-hand attack with reapplying hex.\n\nHex works in all manner of Pact of the Blade Warlock builds. It grants bonus damage regardless of weapon choice, and has a huge cast range to be actively powerful for thrown weapon builds and melee builds alike. It flourishes with characters with high AC or high constitution to have the best chances at maintaining concentration while in the thick of things. \n\n### Temporary Hit Points\nIf you are looking to support a melee centric character outside of raw damage, the Warlock class offers a variety of ways to gain hit points. Fiendish Vigor (*false life* at will), *armor of agathys*, and the fiend's Dark One's Blessing all give you ways to gain temporary hit points and fit great into a variety of different play patterns.\n\nFiendish Vigor often acts as 8 temporary hit points whenever you get out of combat as you can just continue to recast it until you have maximum temp HP. Setting up an encounter with either this or *armor of agathys* means by the time your temporary hit points expire, you'll be just about ready to get a refresh with Dark One's Blessing whenever you drop an enemy. \n\nThese features can provide survivability for the character and can work great in two-weapon fighting builds or single weapon Strength builds. It does require some party coordination to juice these features to the max, but with a bit of practice this build can be quite powerful.  \n\n\n### Pact of the Blade Invocations\nThe Player's Handbook comes with two invocations that interact directly with Pact of the Blade: Thirsting Blade and Lifedrinker.\n\n**Thirsting Blade** gives you the Extra Attack feature and pushes Pact of the Blade warlocks into Fighter and Paladin ranges of damage. Extra Attack is a huge damage bonus. It plays well with *hex*, *faerie fire* and your other weapon attack centric features. Making two greatsword attacks a turn is normally all Fighters can hope to get at 5th level. Warlocks learn a new spell, get a new eldritch invocation, and improve their Pact Magic spell slots to third level. Forgoing the invocation to gain extra attack effectively is Thirsting Blade and should show you how powerful of a feature it is compared to what Barbarians and Fighters are gaining here.\n\nOnce you get to 12th level, **Lifedrinker** might start to look lackluster. It is far from that. With an 18 in Charisma, you are adding +4 to all of your weapon damage rolls. With two greatsword attacks, your dishing out 4d6+16 damage with two hits. Just two. Add hex with your bonus action and it jumps to 6d6+16 damage per round to a single target, every round, all day. Two-weapon builds push the feature even further. Three attacks gives us an extra +4 damage (as we don't get to add our Dex to the damage of off-hand weapon attacks), making our potential damage per round with hex 6d6+20, split into two groups of 2d6+8 and one 2d6+4. This kind of damage is powerful, even at 12th level, and can be used consistently with only 1 Pact Magic spell slot.\n\nThe core issue with Lifedrinker is the Charisma requirement. It asks you to have a primary or secondary stat in Charisma to get the most out of it, which might not reach its maximum potential in some bladelock builds. \n \n### Other Notable Feats and Features\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ogE34cm.jpg\">\n\nAmplifying greatsword builds with **Great Weapon Master** just makes sense. It gives you more choices when swinging your greatsword around, and can push your damage into ludicrous territory. The feat is bonkers. Always take the penalty. +10 to damage is insanity, and making an extra attack when you down an enemy makes a slayer build with Dark One’s Blessing insane. \n\n**Dual Wielder** gives you a bump to AC and damage if you are conjuring a rapier and going in on a Dexterity based build. Hybrid builds with Strength based two-weapon fighting also is fine, but tends to have slightly less survivability in exchange for more opportunities to use brute force to explore with.\n\n**Martial Adept** is a one of the best general feats a Bladelock can pick up. It is similar to picking up an extra spell slot but only for combat spells, and often these maneuvers can be combat warping. Picking up Parry or Rally gives you an extra tool to aid your allies while Riposte and Tripping Attack give the Bladelock even more tools to pump out combat damage. Riposte + Hex + Greatsword = a metric truckload of damage to a single creature.\n\n**Savage Attacker** is a criminally underrated feat in dice heavy builds. It unfortunately does not allow you to reroll your Hex damage [(sage advice)](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/01/26/does-the-savage-attacker-feat-apply-to-sneak-attack-or-divine-smite/) but being able to reroll your low rolls on 2d6 can be great. You can opt in any time you want- the feature is always available.\n\n**Devil's Sight** paired with *darkness* is a Warlock classic that goes great with weapon builds as well. While *darkness* does take up your concentration slot, the advantage you get on attacks and the disadvantage your enemies will be forced to take makes the option appealing to multi-attack builds. It helps that independently both features are excellent utility features as well and can make a great replacement for *hex* if you don't want to take it.\n\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nYou can play a powerful blade lock in a variety of ways with expectations VS your investment in the build. The feature is incredibly flexible. You can get as much out of it as you put into it, but it isn't going to be an all star build around all on its own. It can act as a simple, yet flexible, utility feature but also can be built around with the bonus proficiencies it grants to make hyper focused melee combatants.\n\nWhat powerful features did I miss that pair well with Pact of the Blade?

With a quick whisper to his fey patron, magical luck seeps out of him as an offering and in return fuels is magic. After a breif moment, the sentry yelps and leaps from his chair, darting towards the nearest bathroom. Gibby can feel his own luck being pressed, but he'll take anothers misfortune at the moment to progress towards the soon to be ill-gotten gains. \n\nToday on Hotfix we're looking to address a category of Warlock invocations that don't get much love from the community: invocations that cast one spell using a spell slot per long rest.\n\nHere are the six invocations we'll be adjusting today: Thief of Five Fates, Mire the Mind, Bewitching Whispers, Dreadful Word, Sculptor of Flesh, Sign of Ill Omen. Minions of Chaos is deliberately absent. Summoning magic with short rest spell slots is uniquely powerful compared to these other options.\n\n### When to Change these Invocations \nYou might consider using these hotfixes in place of the core invocations in a variety of circumstances. Because of how comparitively weak the options are perceived when judged against other invocations, players tend to steer away from these and towards more reliable and epic invocations. If your players are having a hard time picking a play style that suits them or feel that they fantasy they are building towards should include one of these weaker invocations, consider this hotfix as a starting point! \n\nThese invocations are generally recieved as underwhelming because they are: \n\n1. comparatively underwhelming to the other existing invocations \n2. tie up two different Warlock resources in one choice (both Eldritch Invocations and Pact Magic) \n3. fail to expand on or improve a play pattern \n \n### Our Three Fixes \nWe're going to be focusing on text all of them share when hotfixing today. Here is their text box where the specific spell is replaced by *spell name*.\n\n> #### Warlock Invocation\n>\n>You can cast *spell name* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n>\n\nHere are our three potential solutions.\n\n### Option 1: Quick Fix \n> #### Warlock Invocation\n>You learn the *spell name* spell. You can cast *spell name* once without consuming a spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n \nThis fix directly powers up the options. It allows you to both learn a spell outside the Warlock spell list and gives you an additional use once per long rest. Players that want to actively fit a spell like *slow* or *bane* into their character concept can do so with this change. Using normal spell slots with your invocation bonus spell can become build and play pattern defining. \n\nIn its current state, Pact Magic focused Warlocks that utilize a hefty spell list to interact with the world are not well-supported. While they shouldn't compete toe-to-toe with wizards and sorcerers, having access to a specific spell one additional time goes a long way to supporting this desired play style. The invocations would still overlap with Pact Magic, but also expands that resource a bit with an extra free use. It also still locks down their concentration which can hurt dedicated *hex* builds. \n\n> #### Warlocks Comparative Place \n> Warlocks have a wonderful home in D&D. By mixing Pact Magic, Invocations, and Pact Boons, players are able to design their own niche character that focuses around a single theme. These focuses tend to be either jack of all trade style characters who dabble in a variety of areas or hyper-focused characters who excel at doing exactly one thing over and over again. \n>\n> Wizards and Sorcerers both have more robust spell lists and more spell slots for a reason. Both lack the choice and flexibility Warlock has access to. Invocations and Boons both give Warlocks reusable tools to act in the world and is the largest part of their comparative advantage against the other classes. \n>\n> When working on the Warlock class, consider these areas of power carefully. In our example, we are trying to bring some of the less frequently used invocations up to par with other existing invocations. We don't want the option to start outshining other classes in fields they are designed to excel at. \n\nThis feature doesn't make the invocations feel epic, though. They end up just being a simple expanded spell list. How do we make unique, engaging invocations out of these?\n\n### Option 2: Remove Concentration \n> #### Warlock Invocation \n> You can cast *spell name* once without consuming a spell slot. If the spell requires concentration, it no longer requires concentration and lasts until no creatures are affected by it or until its duration ends. Once you use this invocation, can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\nBy removing concentration on the spells and giving players a single free use per long rest, these invocations can act as encounter shaping effects. Consider a player enters an encounter and immediatly causes havoc with a *confusion* spell. Next round, regardless of who is still affected, the player is free to move into their regular play pattern by setting up their *hex* or *witch bolt*. These invocations now fit into character builds they didn't before because players can use their bread and butter concentration spells without fear. \n\nAny mechanic that breaks a core rule of the game tends to be powerful. Having an extra concentration slot, even for a specific spell, is powerful. This version removes the resource overlap entirely. Players wouldn't have to juggle concentration spells with their Pact Magic and these invocations. They are less build defining now but instead build supporting. Players take these invocations to supplement existing play styles that already use their concentration slot instead of building around these concentration spells. \n\nThese invocations also play nicely together. The more you have, the more concentration spells you can have up at once. In an epic finale, having up three concentration spells can feel powerful. \n\nIf the option still feels too weak at the table, consider adjusting it further from once per long rest to once per short. Can we make them stand out even more? Can they both be build defining and unique? \n\n### Option 3: Give and Take \nAlright this is one of my weirder designs. This specific option would exclude Sculptor of Flesh and Sign of Ill Omen. Hear me out.\n> #### Warlock Invocation\n> You can cast *spell name* at will, without expending a spell slot. While at least one other creature is affected by the spell, you suffer the spells effect as well. Once no other creature is affected by the spell, the spell ends.\n\nThis option gives Warlock something they have been asking for since their conception: a way to sacrifice to make others suffer. The class fantasy of making a deal with the devil tends to be all upsides. Here is a powerful feature that has a significant downside. *Slow* at will can be powerful and build defining, but are you willing to also be slowed? Bestowing a curse on your enemies as a fey lock seems on point, but- as a mortal wielding fey power- you too suffer from the misfortune *bane* brings. \n\nThis change is the the option I'd be most excited to pick up as a Warlock but also the most volatile and potentially game breaking option. *Slow* warlock builds could focus around getting the most value from your action each round and ignoring bonus actions. Casting *bane* frequently to set up encounters can make a status effect focused Warlock more engaging and encourage mechanical builds that don't want to be making attack rolls or ability checks in combat. \n\nThis makes the invocations build defining similarly to Misty Visions and Fiendish Vigor. It would likely become a major part of the character's kit, and I think would shake up the table the most from being introduced. These should be handled with caution. If you are looking to bring something new and fresh to the table without leaving the comfort of the PHB, however, these fixes might be for you.\n\n## Wrapping Things Up\nWarlock invocations make the class the amazing toolbox class it currently is. Character customization is the core foundation of the class. While they aren't always the best at any specific option, Warlocks always bring a huge array of features to the table to explore the world around them in unconventional ways.\n\nHow do you think these fixes would change the Warlock class? Have you taken these invocations unchanged and really enjoyed them? Do you think these changes are desperately needed or entirely pointless? What changes would you bring to the table to address Minions of Chaos? Let us know on Twitter (@DesignerDungeons) and Facebook (Designer Dungeons) with #Hotfix!\n"}]}}
