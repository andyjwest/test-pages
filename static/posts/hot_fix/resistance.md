# Hotfix: Resistance
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f5/0e/d4/f50ed425ed6a2a3876ab1d1448505bca.jpg">

A shadowy cleric garbed in purple robes overtop a dull chainmail lurks in the background as her allies charge forward. The ancient red dragon they oppose looks about his treasure hoard, spotting the intruders and blasting the halfling rogue with scorching flames. With a quick gesture and subtle incantation made while holding a small leather cloak, a shadowy viel wraps around the halfling, halting the flames for a brief moment and narrowly allowing him to dodge firey doom. 

Resistance is one of my favorite bad spells. The idea behind it is great: a divine or natural blessing that protects yourself or an ally. Its a member of the trifecta of *guidance*, *blade ward*, and *resistance*. Each is supposed to be bolstering a different area of play, but only *guidance* stands out as spectacular at a wide array of tables. *Resistance* has real potential, and can be used proactively in its current state, but it could use some tuning up.

When selecting cantrips, powerful options quickly crowd out the less powerful ones. My goal today is to make small adjustments to *resistance* to give players more reasons to choose it as an integral spell for their characters.

## What's Wrong with Resistance
Resistance can feel bad to use sometimes, and for a bunch of reasons. Some players might be content with the cantrip, and feel it fits in with their core character great. Anecdotally, the spell has been either glossed over for being underwelming or unused when selected. 

The problems with *resistance*:
- Single usage paired with concentration and action slot make it difficult to use proactively.
- The single use can often feel lackluster, especially if the character never ends up making a saving throw.
- It is a proactive buff for a reactive mechanic. Players feel punished when they are suprised and failed to set up the spell. 
- Players have to repeatedly use it to provide resistance against traps and unforseen obstacles, which can slow down the game.

Three times you'd want to Hotfix *resistance*
- A player wants to use resistance, but struggles to weave it meaningfully into their play pattern
- Players feel there aren't any worthwhile cantrips left to take as they progress, and that includes *resistance*
- You want to provide players a more diverse list of comparably powerful cantrips.

> ### Resistance
> 1 Action, VSM (a miniature cloak), Touch, Up to 1 minute (Concentration)
>
>You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after the saving throw. The spell then ends.

### Fix 1: Affects Multiple Saves 
> 1 Action, VSM (a miniature cloak), Touch, Up to 1 minute (Concentration)
>You touch one willing creature and choose a saving throw. Whenever the target makes the chosen saving throw, they add a d4 to the result.

A player has incentive to think ahead about an upcoming encounter; if they are doing battle against a dragon with a Dexsterity save based breath weapon, they can protect an ally or themselves for multiple saves during over time. 

This change improves the useage of the feature in combat and in areas where specific types of saves are expected, but now functions even worse at trap exploration or providing resistance against the unseen. Players who want to play more of a guardian character might want this version, and it could be well suited for tables that don't want to alter the spell too much while still upping the power. It is the most simplistic fix, and will work great in combat heavy games involving lots of preparation beforehand.

If you want a simple version like this but have characters actively using their concentration slot, I'd consider removing concentration from the cantrip and instead having it last until it is cast again or the duration expires. 

### Fix 2: Proactive Reaction Resistance
> 1 Action, VSM (a miniature cloak), Self, up to 1 minute (Concentration)
>
> You radiate protective energy. For the duration, whenever you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add a d4 to the save.

This version fixes nearly all the issues I have with resistance. It requires proactive set up still, but now can be used readily to protect allies and give players ample reason to use it. It suffers from the same required recasting, but at least no longer would require touch.

It requiring the concentration slot can leave it feeling a bit restrictive for characters that want to be concentrating on higher level spells, though, and might be tricky to integrate into level 3+ characters easily. 

This fix would work great at tables with circle of the moon druids who are looking for a better way to use their concentration slot while wild shaped, or any table that isn't optimizing how they are using concentration. Low level tables with clerics and druids looking to play an active supporting role might like this change.

### Fix 3: Reactive Reaction Resistance
> 1 Reaction whenever you or one or more creatures within 30 feet of you make a saving throw, VSM (a miniature cloak), Self, up to 1 minute (Concentration)
>
> You bolster an endangered character, boosting their resiliance. Choose a creature making a saving throw within 30 feet of you. That creature adds a d4 to the roll.

This final fix is a tuned up version of Fix 2. Resistance now would grant druids and clerics a reaction based cantrip they can fire off any time a player makes a saving throw. This version will warp games substantially, and can become a huge reaction tool for the classes to use.

This powerful of a feature removes some of the proactive thought Fix 2 has, and is substantially stronger. If you want a new, powerful, game warping cantrip that greatly improves your parties defensive cabapilities, I'd consider using this fix. Being entirely reactive also will fit in great with players who don't neccisarily think about whats coming next and prepare specifically for the upcoming encounter.

In heavily optimized tables, this fix gives a huge boost to support based clerics and druids. It brings their cantrips closer in line with powerful utility cantrips later, as the bonus can always be useful in all tiers of play and encounters. 

### Closing Thoughts
Adjusting cantrips can be dangerous for play, as these features have unlimited uses and can shape encounters and world building. Do you think any of these *resistance* changes are too powerful at the table? Would you consider taking *resistance* in any of these forms, or is it still to situational for you? Have any new characters in mind who build around this cantrip? Let us know over on Twitter or Discord @DesignerDungeons #Hotfix!
