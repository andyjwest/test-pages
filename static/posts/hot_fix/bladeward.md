# Hotfix: Blade Ward

<img src= "https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5174/5415327544_1faa6ff276_z.jpg">

A elderly dwarf garbed in a blue robe wielding a wand and throwing hammer struts into the arena. The crowd boos the dwarf, but changes their tune when a hill giant gladiator runs into the arena and showboats. The turns and aggresively charges the dwarf, who responds with a bright orange sigil in the air and encasing himself in a feint arcane shield. 

*Blade ward* is one of those cantrips that seems like it has potential but doesn't. In practice, the spell is clunky to use, and doesn't do that much better a job than simply taking the dodge action. The fantasy of conjuring a protective ward is an epic one. The spell could be way better to live up to this idea.

Today on Hotfix, we're breaking down this barrier to using *blade ward*. These three fixes all change how and when the spell can be used, and can give players meaningful defensive options they can use that don't become oppressive in optimized builds.

## Whats Wrong
As usual, here is the official text of the spell.
> ### Blade Ward
> Abjuration cantirp
>
> Casting time: 1 Action, Target: Self, VS, Duration: 1 round 
>
> You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks. 

What's wrong with blade ward 
- Action cost is too severe. 
- Polarizing power level: it can be oppressively powerful when used frequently.
- Many encounters won't include weapon attacks at all. This can make the cantrip useless most of the time. 

When should you use one of these fixes?
- A bladesinger, abjurer, or other caster wants a defensive cantrip to boost their survivability. 
- The cantrip options for a character feel lackluster, and the player wants comparable spells to choose from. 
- You want an easier way to protect monsters from weapon damage to adjust for a comparatively too powerful weapon based character. 

### Fix 1: Reactive Warding
> Casting time: 1 Action, Target: Self, VS, Duration: 1 minute (Concentration) 
>
> You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. For the duration, whenever you are hit by an attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage.

This itteration of Blade Ward makes it quite a bit more powerful at the cost of a reaction. While it still requires the action to set it up, you can continue to benefit from the cantrip over multiple rounds. Characters that make great constitution saving throws or have the war caster feat can juice this feature for a long time by maintaining conenctration on it and halving damage selectively.

This version also opens up the ward to protect against any form of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage instead of locking it to weapons. While primarily you will be resisting weapons, sometimes you'll be warding against claws or beaks now. 

This fix will work great with players that don't have the *shield* spell, or tables that want more reactive chocies to make. While powerful, the distinction between reducing all weapon damage by half to one attack per round targets this version of the feature at characters looking to only take 1-2 attacks a round. Characters looking to wade into the thick of things and be attacked more than this still might prefer this option over the existing *blade ward*, but we can design a better option for those tank abjurers out there.

### Fix 2: Double the Duration
> Casting time: 1 Action, Target: Self, VS, Duration: 2 rounds 
>
> You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. For the duration of this spell you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Fix 2 is the simpler than the prior fix by adding an extra round to the duration of the spell. This alleviates some of the pressure from it costing an action to use. It gives you the ability to blade ward every other round if you want to maintain the resistances instead of requiring it be used every round. 

This version also recieved the quality of life update to be any kind of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage instead of specifically weapon based bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage.

Fix 2 works great at tables with eldritch knights and abjurers looking to sit in the middle of combat and get attacked by a lot of monsters at once. It costing an action still leaves it being fairly prohibitive, but its extended duration should provide more moments where it can feel like a good choice to use instead of just taking the dodge action. 

### Fix 3: Adaptive Ward
> Casting time: 1 Bonus Action, Target: Self, VS, Duration: 1 round 
> You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Choose a damage type. The next time you would take damage from the chosen damage type you have resistance against that damage until the end of your next turn. Once you gain resistance in this way, the spell ends. 

Fix 3 opens up a whole new world of possibilities with the option. Characters who are looking for something to do with their bonus action can set up the ward and predict what kind of damage might be coming there way. Being able to still cast a spell or make attacks makes *blade ward* feel way better to use. 

Additionally, being able to choose any damage type dramatically increases the number of encounters where this spell can shine. Limiting the type of damage also keeps the power in line with other defensive options classes have access to like the monk's patient defense.  

This is probably the strongest of the three fixes, but still can be restrictive. Characters who frequently use bonus actions will have a harder time weaving this cantrip into their play pattern. Players looking for a way to use their bonus action, however, can find this is an appealing option that gives them a rewarding tool for reacting to a variety of attacks in an encounter. 

### Closing Thoughts 
*Blade ward* is a worrying cantrip from a mechanical perspective. Resistance to three forms of damage early and consistently can make normally difficult encounters a breeze.  These version are aimed at taking the idea of a protective cantrip and make it feel powerful to use without making a character feel invincable. 

What do you think about these changes? Am I too scared of the three damage resistances on a cantrip, or do you think maybe I went too far and made these options too powerful?
