# Hotfix: Wild Shape

<img src="http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/posts/LoneDruid_full.jpg">

Alright boys and girls, this one is going to be a *bear* to get through because our hotfixed feature is no *mouse* when it comes to size. I really hope I don't get *rat*ted out on twitter for some of these *wild* ideas.

Okay, enough of that nonsense. Today we're Hotfixing wild shape.  


## Wild Shape
>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or Long Rest.
>Your druid level determines the Beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a Challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.
>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You automatically revert if you fall Unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die.
>
>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
> - Your game Statistics are replaced by the Statistics of the beast, but you retain your Alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. 
> - You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. 
> - If the creature has any legendary or Lair Actions, you can't use them.
> - When you transform, you assume the beast's Hit Points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren't knocked Unconscious.
> - You can't cast Spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your Concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking Actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
> - You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your Special Senses, such as Darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
> - You choose whether your Equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn Equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of Equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your Equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any Equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

## Why Change Wild Shape
- The comlpexity of the feature scares players away from the option, or slows down play at the table 
- A druid at your table is frustrated with wild shape in combat
- As a DM, the large pool of hit points the druid is gaining feels insurmountable without also threatening to smash the rest of the party

Lets break it down, shall we?

## Fix 1: Text Reduction 
>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
>Your druid level determines the Beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a Challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.
>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to your druid level. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using your bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die.

>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
> - Your game Statistics are replaced by the Statistics of the beast, but you retain your Alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. 
> - You  retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If you and the creature share a proficiency, use whichever is higher. 
> - When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. 
> - You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
> - You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them.
> - You choose whether your Equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Any Equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

Here is the TLDR; we've made transforming in and out of Wild Shape take a bonus action isntead of an action, removed the conditional loss of extra senses and class features limited to the form, changed its duration from half your druid level to just your druid level, and cut out the section on Legendary and Lair actions, as no applicable beast has either. That kind of text we might have to add to Moon Druids, but there isn't any reason to bog down an already lengthy feature with extra text if it doesn't apply to the base feature. 

We also cut out any of the double negatives that were unneccisary. Statements such as "Transforming doesn’t break your Concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking Actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you’ve already cast," are purely used for clarity and bog down an already complex feature too much. If the option doesn't prohibit, it allows. The feature doesn't specify you CAN'T maintain concentration on a spell, so it is assumed you still can. 

This doesn't altar the feature all that much, but hopefully makes it a little less daunting to read through. It adds a bit more consistecy throughout the option as well. This fix doesn't adjust the feature mechanically, though. In addition to this fix, I'll include a table with all the possible beasts by level as another tool to help newer players or players who don't want to mess with the normal monster that is wild shape have an easier time digesting their choices and understanding how the feature works.

How do we altar wild shape if its a balance issue, though? Fix 1 gives it a few buffs, but what do we do if its a problem?

## Fix 2: Health Adjustments 
Here is the selection of text we're altaring: 
> When you transform, you assume the beast’s Hit Points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren’t knocked Unconscious.

Here is our recommended change: 

> When you transform, you assume the beast’s Hit Points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed minus the total hit points you lost in your beast form, minimum of 1. If you revert as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

What this change does it reduce the total hit point pool druids who use wild shape to soak damage have access to. It allows for a druid with low hit points in wild shape to be knocked unconcious fairly easily, when before the druid would have no worries about the incoming damage with their base hit point pool to fall back on. Now, druids who transform into small creatures will function nearly identically, while druids who transform into larger, healthier creatures will still benefit from an HP bonus, but less than before. 

Quick example: I'm a 10 hit point druid who wild shapes into a 15 hit point beast. I take 18 damage from a max damage burning hands (how unlucky!). The beast form takes 15 damage, which then I subtract from my druid's normal hit point pool to a minimum of 1. Now, from my 1 hit point, I take the remaining 3 points of damage, knocking me unconcious. 

If the hit points Moon Druids have isn't too much of an issue for you, but you still want the feature reworked to improve the feature so druids have more to do in combat, try out this next fix!


## Fix 3: Casting in Wildshape 
Alright, fair warning this one BY FAR is the most radical and controversial of the three, and will have the largest impact on game play. 

All we're doing is altaring one section.

This
> You can’t cast Spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your Concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking Actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you’ve already cast.

becomes this
> You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, and can cast spells requiring material components by wearing or holding a druidic focus. You can't consume material components otherwise. 

Yes, giving an 18th level feature at level 2 seems crazy, but I promise the majority of tables will have no problems with these changes. Instead, druid's will have greater opportunities to do cool things in combat. If you are an animal in wild shape, often your action pool is incredibly limited. Your character has a huge list of prepared spells that are all entirely unavalible until you shift out of form. Letting these two features overlap is crucial to the health of the class. It keeps players engaged and excited to be able to build a specific way and take ownership of all parts of their character. 

Lets talk real quick about when you should implement this radical shift at the table. If a player is playing a circle of the moon druid is getting bored of their character, I'd seriously consider allowing both fix 2 and 3 together at the table. This reels in the power of wild shape while siultaneosly giving the druid ways to use all of their features as opposed to losing half of them for a giant hit point pool. It makes characters able to be cooler. Let players make their characters cooler. It also adds a meaningful decision to casting; do I spend my spell slots on spells, or use them to self heal? Players now have that choice to make, as opposed to defaulting to sinking spell slots into hit points because they can't use them for anything else.

For your circle of the land druids or other druids who don't actively use wild shape as a combat feature, this change opens up a ton of creative choice to players. If you want to inspire players to do creative things and come up with alternate approaches to standard combat, I'd introduce this change. If your players are already great at this and tend to focus more on the most optimal strategy at any given time, I'd avoid this change, as it can be abused fairly easily with burrow speeds and tiny creatures. Wild shape can be a great utility feature to supplement spell casting druids, but they don't neccisarily need this change to flourish. It might help players struggling to find creative solutions, though. 

## Closing Thoughts

In my opinion, the biggest mistake within the druid class is its clear anti-synergy. In order to use one of your two major class features, you literally can't be using the other. This change fixes that, but in an incredibly powerful way. This is a rare hotfix where all three fixes can be used together or independetly. 

What do you think about these changes? Is druid casting in wild shape to overpowered? Do I not suffiecently address the hit point problem? What other cool ways can you think of to give druids in wild shape more to do? Let me know over on Twitter, @DesignerDungeons!
