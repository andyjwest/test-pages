The ambusher fantasy is a frequent request I get from players: a character who uses stealth and preparation to get the drop on their foes for their parties advantage. Goblin ambush leaders, elven scouts, and halfling assassin all are character types that fit within this fantasy. Without ample choices outside of rogue, though, how else do we represent the hit out of nowhere playstyle? I think through **fighting styles**.

In addition, some environmental fighting styles have been tested within the core Unearthed Arcana articles. The mariner fighting style took a swing at empowering pirate and seafaring characters. I think the initial option was lackluster, and want to create fighting styles that open up characters to feel awesome when fighting in and around water.

Fighting styles fundamentally provide a core play pattern element to character builds. A fighter with archery is encouraged to use a shortbow while one with protection wants a shield in their off hand as often as possible and an ally at their side. Mechanically, the options are passive- the character doesn't consume any resources to use them, and they fundamentally improve the characters basic play style. 

This is the critical element of fighting styles and what makes them challenging to make fairly; as a passive bonus that is intended to be used over and over, it's much easier to see an overpowering element here than we’d normally find in a resource based feature. We need to design an engaging and fantasy driven option to open up player availability to using their favorite combat type, but not make it so powerful it outshines other fighting styles and makes them feel worse to choose.

Here are two iterations of the fighting style I would consider giving to a player looking to fulfil this character concept. The first fits in well with the existing options and expands a solo-play style. The second instead pushes in the direction of Protection by working more as a team focused ability that encourages cooperation and rewards teamwork.


>### Fighting Style: Bushwacker
>
> Whenever you would select a fighting style from the ranger or fighter class, you may instead choose this fighting style.
>
> You gain a +2 bonus to initiative.
>
> Add a d6 to weapon attack and damage rolls made against creatures that have not acted in combat yet.



> ### Fighting Style: Ambush Leader
>
> Whenever you would select a fighting style from the ranger or fighter class, you may instead choose this fighting style.
>
>You gain a +2 bonus to initiative.
>
> You and allied creatures within 5 feet of you deal an additional d6 damage with weapon attacks against creatures that have not acted in combat yet.

Finally, I’ve created two environment specific fighting style. This style should only be taken in games that *heavily* focus combat in and out of the specific environment which in this instance is under-water combat. The first feature works alongside our Hotfix for the month, while the second can be used in any game focusing on the ocean.

> ### FIghting Style: Aquatic Weapon Fighting 
>
> Whenever hit a creature with an **aquatic** weapon while under water, it takes an additional weapon die of damage. If the creature doesn’t have a swim speed, its movement is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. 


> ### Fighting Style: Natatory Combatant 
>
> You have a swim speed equal to your movement speed.
>
> Whenever a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you or an ally within 5 feet of you while underwater, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.


## Flavor VS Function
Fighting styles focus primarily on function first to then encourage flavor. Take the Dueling fighting style, for example. Dueling says:

> #### Dueling
>
> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

This doesn't explain the who or why behind the feature. It is a means of improving one-handed weapons in combat without rhyme or reason. This improvement shapes what a character with it looks like. A duelist might look to take advantage of a lone longsword or rapier. They can't be using a two-handed weapon or an off-hand weapon to gain this advantage. It shapes the flavor of the character by offering mechanical reward for weapon and fighting style choice.

When designing fighting styles, it is important to consider the comparative weakness of a particular play pattern against other existing. Using Dueling again, we know that one-handed weapons tend to deal less damage than a player would otherwise do dual wielding or with a two-handed weapon. The mechanical boost then helps characters fulfil a fantasy of playing a sword and board fighter or a noble duelist while continuing to feel like they are doing fair amounts of damage compared to other existing builds they could have pursued instead.


## Bounds
Fighting styles can quickly prove too powerful in some builds. Repeatable features that adjust a core play pattern need to be comparatively reasonable with other existing options more so than infrequent resource abilities. A character that is seriously outperforming others consistently can lead to other players around the table feeling bad about their play pattern and damage, and can lead to circumstances where DMs have to design encounters around challenging a single player.

The existing fighting styles do an excellent job staying within the bounds of normal play patterns. A ranger with the archery fighting style feels good about using their ranged weapon with a +2 bonus while the rest of the table likely doesn't feel oppressed by the extra 10% of die rolls that are now hits that weren't before.

The best defining feature for bounds is the Great Weapon Fighting style.

> #### Great Weapon Fighting
>
>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

This encourages use of a high damage weapon without expanding the already powerful option’s damage range above other tactics. The mechanic gives players a tool that slightly increases the *average* damage of the already heavily damaging weapons without increasing the *maximum* damage. This key difference helps the option  feel powerful in a players hands. Switching a pair of 1s/2s to 5s/6s feels amazing, but it doesn’t give the feature tools to overpower others as a flat +1 or +2 would. What is important is that this damage still fits within the regular bounds the weapon would deal. Greatswords can already deal 12 damage max and 2 min. This feature leaves those two core elements in tact while emphasizing the strength and uniqueness of fighting with two-handed weapons.

## Building a Fighting Style
So how do we start building a fighting style?

### Step 1: Target a Style of Fighting
It seems straight forward, but an actual difficult part of designing fighting styles is targeting an option that doesn't get what it wants from other fighting styles. Ranged characters and most weapon specific options tend to already be covered with the core fighting styles.

What you could consider looking into would be classic looks like the net and trident gladiator. If we are creating a fighting style that supports using attacks for options other than damage we have a huge amount of untapped design space to work in. 

It’s important to consider a play styles comparative weakness against others and determine where the option shines and where its weak. If an options current strength isn't strong enough to make it feel awesome to use, we improve the strength. Protection is a great example of this- a defensive, shield wielding fighter wants to protect their party but their weren't great ways to do that before. Protection lets the boost to a characters own AC help protect their allies.

Alternatively, a fighting style might already be plenty powerful but is held back by its weakness. Duelist is an example of this. When a character wants to be a sword and board self-sufficient character, they normally have to trade off some damage because they are forced into using a one handed weapon. This fighting style lessons that weakness to other builds while letting the utility of an open hand shine through use of shields, grapples, or other item usage.

Here is a starting idea table of fighting style possibilities and the weaknesses the option would look to overcome or additional strengths to build upon:

|Style|Weakness|Strength|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Tripper| Easy to get up, action consumptive|Set up allies, set up self|
|Reach| Two-handed, heavy, moderate damage| Attack of opportunity range, locking down an area|
|Versatile| Lower in damage, require open hand to switch|Flexibly switch between damaging modes and free hand|
|Medium Ranged Weapons| Low damage, low range| Unique item, room to create|
|Ambusher| One moment of power, then fall off, initiative dependent| Get free attacks, early lead in the encounter|
|Aquatic| Limited weapon types, hindered without swim speed, limited area of use| Areas of superiority, environmental hindrance on non-aquatic|

### Step 2: Mechanical Exploration
Now that we have some idea as to what style we want to build and their strengths and weaknesses, we want to look into what kind of mechanical shifts we want the fighting style to apply.

5th has some core design elements that discourage large amounts of numbers stacking together. This doesn't mean we can't apply straight bonuses to rolls (like how Archery does), but simply encourages us to represent those numbers in a more engaging way. Rolling dice is a great way to improve a feature like how bardic Inspiration and *guidance* works.

This in mind, when we go about fulfilling player fantasy through mechanical boons we want to target numerical differences in unique and engaging ways. In our design example, we are encouraging the player to set up surprise rounds to get large bonuses to themselves and allies and does so by giving them more dice to roll as part of their natural attacks.

> ### Avoid Advantage
>
> I would discourage using features like advantage when dealing with the self. Advantage is a mechanic that largely revolves around players working together to achieve a greater goal. It shows the "advantage" they gain when players work together, best depicted by the Help action.
>
> Giving players a fighting style that turns on advantage for themselves is simple, sure, but ultimately discourages players from working together to set up more team based moments of epicness as advantage doesn’t stack with itself.

This is a play pattern defining feature, and will be on display a large portion of the time. Mechanics that force saving throws or affect a large group of characters at once and have them roll dice all at once can slow game play down, and ideally we'd like to avoid these kinds of hindrances.

Flat bonuses to checks made that involve your given fighting style is an easy way to implement a fighting style. Removing penalties, like the two-weapon fighting style does, is another easy way to build a fighting style. 

One last way to easily design fighting styles is giving the player more opportunities to act. Protection shows this off the bests- it gives players frequent access to a defensive maneuver that protects their allies. A Tripper fighting style might take advantage of a character standing up from being prone by reducing their speed to 0 to help lock them in place.

### Step 3: Make Three
Whenever drafting up a new ability, I seriously recommending making three different versions of the option. This can help get the creative juices flowing and gives you easy features to compare it to. Find a variety of mechanics that are involved around the feature, and see what different implementations look like with each.

For our ambusher archetype idea, I knew I wanted the option to affect creatures based on the surprise round and the initiative system. The fighting style should reward characters with high initiative and push them towards attacking unaware or slow acting creatures.


Three mechanics that tend to be tied to ambushes are Stealth, initiative modifier, and surprise attacks.

> #### Bushwacker 1
>
> Whenever you attack a creature that can't see you, you gain a +3 bonus to hit and damage.

My first iteration focused in on attacking from an unseen place outside of initiative. This ended up feeling too similar to rogue's play pattern- all the builds I was thinking of that would want this feature dipped at least two into rogue for Cunning Action to really break this ability. On top of that, the numerical advantage doesn't feel all that awesome. While its higher than other classes, it encourages a solo play experience that I want to avoid where a player jumps down, attacks a monster 4-5 times and kills it before it or their allies get to act.

> #### Bushwacker 2
>
>You gain a +2 bonus to initiative.
>
>Add your initiative modifier to attack rolls made against creatures that haven't acted in combat yet (in addition to other modifiers).

The second was my attempt to "weaponize" initiative. It has a problem where it just confirms a hit against a creature that hasn't acted, though. It doesn't target the weakness surprise attacks tend to have, nor does it really improve the strength all that much as you tend to have an easier time attacking unaware creatures. Combined with the potential confusion of Dexterity going both into attacks and initiative, I found this option just wasn't a good fit.

> #### Bushwacker 3
>
> You and allied creatures within 5 feet of you deal an additional d6 damage with weapon attacks against creatures that have not acted in combat yet.

The third took the "raid leader" concept to fruition. I wanted a tactical ambush style mechanic. This feature allows players to work with their other martial characters to set up an epic ambush where they can get a round to a round and half of bonus damage dice against unaware creatures. One flaw with the option, however, was its rampant inconsistency. If you rolled low on initiative, you might get one or two hits with this feature in the surprise round (assuming you got one) and then the feature fizzles as other characters act before you.

I ended up going with the third feature with a bit of modification. It encouraged teamwork (something we are all about here) and helped fulfil a very specific fantasy well. With a small boost to initiative to sure up the amount of times you'll have targets to take advantage of this feature with, we get a more consistent fighting style that encourages players to get the drop on their enemies led by the fighter or ranger.

## Concluding Thoughts
What do you think about Bushwacker and Ambusher Leader? What about the aquatic fighting styles? Should Ambush Leader work with spell casters to improve ranged Ambush Leaders? Is the allied range too restrictive? Do you think they are too niche, too general, or do they help add consistency to specific character fantasies?
