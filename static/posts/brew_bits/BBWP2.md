"Bah! Cursed jelly beasts, they ruined my cloak of academia! Note to self: fire is of little use. Their unnatural constitution baffles me. Its as if they are adapting to my every move, increasing in power in exchange for what? Service to some elder entity? No matter. I will continue my search until the bitter end. As the old adage goes, fool me once, shame on me. But fool me twice-"

- Kalimor Kalimorious, wizard extraordinaire, as he stumbled over a ledge into a pool of ochre jelly.

Welcome back to Brew Bits: Warlock eddition! On our [prior article](), we looked at the first level and general layout for designing Warlock Otherwordly Patrons. 


[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RZ0XZ271P1mh7Fmj7OSErrUquVDrSnCy) is the warlock patron we're using, with updated level 6 features and an additional Warlock Invocation and spell to provide even more expanded options for Warlocks! We'll be referencing the Endless Ooze throughout the article as a practicle example of design. 

For reference, here is the general design format for Otherwordly Patrons that we presented last time.

### Feature Breakdown 
Existing warlock patrons tend to be built using the following design pattern.

|Warlock Level| Type of Feature| 
|:--:|:--|
|1st| A generic build around ability and an expanded spell list.
|6th| A defensive feature that helps get you out of sticky situations.
|10th| A passive defensive enhancement.
|14th| A powerful tool that reflects the flavor of the class in a powerful way. 

Today we're looking into the 6th, 10th and 14th level feature. Each is less class defining than the level 1 features, but they all bring some unique design decisions to the table relative to the levels they are presented. 

Additionally, the class context continues to grow in complexity the higher level a character gets. Invocations and spells both are harder to avoid overlap with, but we'll do our best to present ways to work around these constraints and break into fun and engaging areas of play. 

### Designing 6th level
Designing a 6th level feature presents some open areas to work in. While most options presented are defensive, they by no means are required to be. There are a few existing examples we can base our designs off of, but this is a great place to stray and explore other potential areas for growth. 

We'll primarily focus on three areas of design to consider: defensive toolbox, core expansion, and new toys. The Endless Ooze has an example of each built in to give players the feature of their choice to open up more decisions and custimization for the class. 


> ### Aspect of the Ooze
>
> At 6th level, choose one of the following aspects to adopt.
>
>***Gelatinous Cube: Transparent.*** As an action, you can mutate your form and any equipment you are carrying, becoming transparent for up to 1 minute. While you are not moving or taking other actions, it takes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you with a DC equal to your Warlock spell save DC + your Constitution modifier. A creature that tries to enter your space while unware of you is surprised by you.
>
>Once you use this feature, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
>
> ***Ochre Jelly: Amorphous Flight.*** In dangerous circumstances you can reactively transform into a pool of ooze. As a reaction to taking damage, you can become **amorphous** until the start of your next turn and move up to your speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. 
>
> You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and regain all expended uses upon finishing a short or long rest. 
>
> ***Grey Ooze: Errosion.*** As a bonus action, you can take on the metal corroding property of a gray ooze. For 1 minute, any nonmagical weapons made of metal that hit you corrode. As a reaction to taking damage from a metal weapon, you can cause the weapon to take a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits you is destroyed after dealing damage.
>
> As an action, you can touch and destroy up to 1 foot of non-magical metal for the duration of the ability. 
>
> Once you use this feature, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### Defensive Toolbox
When we look to the core books, the Warlock subclasses all have some sort of defensive toolbox feature. In my opinion, the Fey and Fiend options are great examples of design while the Great Old One is rather poor. The core difference between the three is both the Fey and Fiend options act both as defensive features as well as utility features for exploring the world. They provide teleportation/invisibility or bonuses to skill checks while the Great Old One gives a small amount of protection in the form of disadvantage with the possibility of setting up advantage on the next attack. The first two tools are useful in a variety of circumstances, while the latter can only be used in a very specific circumstance. 

We can learn from these designs. Creating a feature that gives Warlocks better tools to navigate combat can help bolster the class in encounters. The feature becomes powerful when this is paired along side exploration tools. It asks players to be creative and balance what tools they should use when.

Errosion is a great example of this kind of feature. It opens up new tools to explore the world with while also providing a powerful defensive feature in the thick of things. The feature asks the player to make decisions on when to use the feature. Should they use it to escape the jail cells by eating away the bars, or should they save it for the inevitable encounter with the palace guards? 

#### Core Expansion
An option that gives a character more of what it already has or improves on what it could originally do directly is a core expansion. Amorphous flight could be considered a core expansion. It takes something the class already does well and expands it out into more circumstances. A character with both amorphous flight and mutable form is incredibly slippery. They are well versed at moving around a melee combat environment and slipping in and out of tight spaces with ease. 

We can look to Trickery Domain cleric's Invoke Duplicity and Improved Duplicity serve as a direct example. One provides a useful tool that is core to the play pattern Trickery Domain brings to the table. The other expands the feature by creating more duplicates and empowering the cleric do get even more creative with how they use these duplicates. 

Raw increase of numeric bonuses is techincally a core expansion. If, for example, the Fiend's first level feature improved by +3 at 6th level, it would fit within this category. However, straight numeric bonuses are particularly exciting or interesting and tend to be quite powerful. When looking to build a core expansion feature, consider expanding out when and how an ability can be used in place of increasing the numeric bonuses or number of dice rolled using it. 


#### New Toys 
Our first example of a 6th level feature, Transparent, is a concrete example of this style of feature. 



The fiend's level six feature is similar- it can be used on both saving throws AND ability checks, making it a defensive tool for when you fail a saving throw in the thick of things but also a feature that can bolster your chances at succeeding on any old ability check. The flexibility of the defensive feature is a great premise to design around. Making a feature players can use in ways outside the norm helps them feel awesome for figuring that out. Mist Escape is another great example- a warlock might prick themselves with a dagger to activate misty escape as just an invisible 60 ft. teleport outside of combat. 

This feature doesn't need to be defensive- if your first level feature encouraged defensive play, consider just adding a tool to the subclasses tool box players can mess around with in a variety of situations in and out of combat that alters the space they are working with. 

I’d recommend at least keeping the feature tied to a number of uses per rest or a feature that lets players take a new action or bonus action. Having more stuff to do at this level is needed when Warlocks are limited in spells per encounter by pact magic. 

The full Endless Ooze patron includes a greater diversity of 6th level features to choose from and will be coming out within a future project that’s currently a WIP. Try to always include diverse features that give players opportunities for customization and self-expression. 

### Level 10 Feature
At 10 warlocks tend to get a boring feature. Passive bonuses don't inherently feel epic, yet they bring a level of epic-ness to the character when effects that hinder the rest of the party fail to affect you. 

With this line of thought, I've presented the most basic iteration of the 10th level feature I'm happy with. What is important to every feature in the game is a sense of ownership. Here, players can pick from a variety of damage types to customize how their body has transformed. It takes on the normal effect of a 10th level feature while still feeling unique to the option. Ooze-locks have a greater constitution than other warlocks tend to have and a feature that supports having a higher Constitution. 

When building your own, consider how to make this passive feel unique and attached to your patron. Basic resistances and condition immunities are the easiest way to present the feature, but I'd seriously encourage digging into niche mechanics. Explore what you can do in the system- adding in dice rolling effects and dice manipulation is a great way to make a passive trait feel alive and unique to your option. 

### Level 14 Feature
Here is the coolest feature to design for your patron. This is your big flashy ability that best represents the patron and their warlocks- it is an awesome tool that players use to tie together the flavor of their subclass with the mechanics of their class. 

Our example shows a powerful feature tied to the most iconic of oozes. A player becoming a large amorphous blob that then devours a smaller creature just feels epic. It deals a fair chunk of damage but most importantly emphasizes the player fantasy that the player has been developing these past 14 levels. 

When building your own, you can build any variety of feature. Ours is similar to Hurl through Hell but modeling yours after Create Thrall can be an equally awesome ability. You can branch out into weirder design space here, too- this is the place for your awesome Warlock features that don’t fit anywhere else.

Anything that has a huge effect on the character that emphasizes the patron fantasy best should go here. By this level, most door ways are open as far as mechanics go- feel free to make a powerful feature to mess around with. You'd rather have a feature that is too strong here than too weak, and it’s okay to slowly real it in over time if it proves to be oppressing other players at the table.
