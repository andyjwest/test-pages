## Brew Bits: Druid Circles

Beautiful, vibrantly colored coral lights the ocean floor with a magical rainbow glow. A band of sahuagin circle threateningly around a wiry elf and her comrades as tunnels of exotic fish and strange sea life dance around the two parties. Hands raised, the elf begins speaking in the sahuagin’s coarse tongue attempting to calm the situation. She knew entering their reef would cause conflict. As an ambassador of both land and sea, if anyone can calm these bloodthirsty sharks, its her.

The next few Brew Bits articles will be on designing druid circles. Druid circles are unique beasts to work with. The class has two key features, wild shape and spellcasting, to build around. They establish a baseline to build off of, and the two base druid circles highlight each independently.


### Context
With the release of *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, new druid options were born and blew away the prior design constraints the original two archetypes held. Their features strayed from the classes two iconic features in favor of new, exciting tools that changed up how the class felt to play.

While this shift in design certainly helps make characters more unique and opens up tempting options that any level two druid may consider, the departure from the core abilities I feel can abandon what makes druids appealing in the first place. The circle of the shepherd bolsters summoning magic while dreams enhances teleportation. Neither provide core improvements to early spell casting nor do either interact with wild shape. 

The circle of spores presented *Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica* does the best job bringing a distinct way to use both halves of the core class together harmoniously. With just their second level features, the class offers distinct ways to use both spellcasting and wild shape. Circle of spores embraces all of the druid class.

With all of these variations in mind, I'm going to start things off with an example druid circle: the Circle of the Tides. From here, we can explore what decisions I made and why and how we can look to existing druid options for inspiration and guidance in designing our own options.

### Designing New Circles
The core to designing druid circles is to iron out early what you want the option to be good at and enhancing it over time. The core druid class is a spectacular backdrop to bring new features to, and allows for wildly different characters to exist within the class.

A druid that builds entirely around wild shape, for example, will be shapeshifting into monstrous beasts and mauling people while a druid devoted to the arctic or coast will bring a diverse kit of spells to the table that show off their favored terrain.

Circle of the tides showcases how to design circles with clear identity. It thrives under water both in and out of wild shape, and brings the sea to the land when it needs to. It has features that support both being in wild shape and out, but has natural requirements that will help guide players to master balancing each play style around their access to water.

### Druid Circle: Circle of the Tides
Their ship shakes. Sounds of creaking wood and snapping planks echo through the hull. "Where is it coming from?" "Stop the incoming water, find the sea witch!" As the pirates scramble to the breaking hull, a huge, rose octopus coated in sigils and wearing strange shells and undersea garments crashes through the base and grapples several of the brigands. She's here on a rescue mission, and these thugs won’t get in her way.

An bearded man coated in tattoos garbed in a blue robe floats on his back down stream. To his pleasant surprise, a group of salmon approach him. He lifts his hand and the water rises with it forming small pools and rings for the fish to swim through. As if they were children, the salmon break from their journey and spend the afternoon playing and swimming with this druid who laughs jovially.

Druids who adopt the circle of the tides share a deep connection with water. These characters understand the importance of water as both a foundation of life and a dangerous force. While often solitary, groups of these druids come together to perform rituals monthly to celebrate and teach newcomers ancient tradition. When danger arises that threatens aquatic entities and waterways they live in, druids of the tide use the vast connecting networks of rivers, oceans and lakes to rally together to defend them.


>#### Aquatic Pet
>Whenever creating a druid, you can optionally start the game with a CR 0 beast as a pet. If you're planning on adopting the circle of the tides, consider choosing a beast from the following table.
>
>|d6|Pet|
>|:--:|:--|
>|1| Frog|
>|2| Goldfish (reflavored Sea Horse)|
>|3| Sea Horse|
>|4| Crab|
>|5| Octopus|
>|6| Quipper|
>
>Your pet does its best to obey your commands. If your pet breaths underwater and can not survive above water, you have a small glass bowl for it to survive in.

Druids belonging to this circle are known for their distinct personalities. Optionally, whenever you select this option at 2nd level, you can choose to adopt a quirk from the following table by either choosing any of your choice or rolling on the table.

#### Quirks
|d8|Quirk|
|:--:|:--
|1| You have a friendly, symbiotic relationship with the folliage and fauna that have made homes in your hair and on your skin.
|2| You feel free in the water. To be free, one must be nude.
|3| After coming out of an aquatic wild shape, your expressions mimic aquatic creatures for a few minutes.
|4| Rain storms are times for celebration!
|5| You compare people to varying bodies of water when describing personality and emotion.
|6| You stop and take time to converse with small aquatic creatures you come across.
|7| You hum sea shanties and rain based nursery rhymes while working.
|8| You carry two or three more waterskins than you'll ever realistically need.


#### Spells of the Tides
Whenever you select this druid circle at 2nd level, choose one of the following bodies of water. You relate to this water way in some way. Perhaps it has always been your home or a location where a defining event shaped who you are today.

You learn a cantrip at 2nd level from the chosen body. The chosen bodies also have recommended spell selections to prepare. If your chosen body recommends a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Shape the Flow
Additionally at 2nd level, as an action you blast a stream of water 5 feet wide and 30 feet long from you in any direction. Choose one of the following effects:

- **Scalding.** Creatures within the stream must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 fire damage from the scalding stream, and half as much on a successful save. This damage increases to 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 9th level, 5d8 at 13th level, and 6d8 at 17th level.
- **Soothing.** Creatures within the stream regain 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier hit points. The number of healing dice increases to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8  at 9th level, 4d8 13th level, and 5d8 at 17th level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Underwater Empathy
At 6th level, your connection to water has given you the ability to bolster creatures around you to survive beneath the waves. You can breathe underwater and have a swim speed equal to your movement speed. Friendly creatures within 15 feet of you can breathe underwater and have a swim speed equal to their movement speed.

Whenever you or an ally within the area makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill check with a creature with a natural swim speed, add a d6 to the roll. This die improves to a d8 at 10th level and a d10 at 14th level.

A creature who leaves this area retains its effects for 1 minute.

#### Predatory Aquatic Forms
Additionally at 6th level, you can attack twice instead of once when you take the attack action on your turn if both attacks are a bite, claw, or tentacle attack.

#### Hear the Tides
At 10th level, your ability to navigate waterways is heightened. You can perform a ritual by submerging yourself in a natural body of water for 10 minutes, and receive the following bonuses if you do so:

- You know the direction and distance to the nearest inhabited area.
- You know if any outsiders (fiend, fey, celestial, elemental, aberration) are within 5 miles of your location and what directions they are in.
- You know the description of the last creature without a swim speed to touch the water at this location.
 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

#### Sea and Sky
At 14th level, you gain the supernatural ability to convert the sky into a liquid like state. Choose a 120 foot area within 60 feet of you. The following effects persist within the area for 1 minute:

- The area glows faintly blue.
-  Creatures can swim through the area as if it were full of water.
- Creatures that normally can't breath out of water can breath in the area.
- Creatures that can't breath under water can't breath in the area.
- Ranged weapon attacks made from outside the area into the area automatically miss unless made with an **aquatic*** weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.


## Closing Thoughts
There is a lot more to talk about when it comes to designing druid circle. Don't worry, more is coming. By starting with a custom example, references later can help explain deviations from core books and look at ways to approach various designs within D&D. Plus, who doesn't love new archetypes?

For those interested in printing this out and playing it paper only, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FL6uzd7wiTg7G2cRBpY7ZEuhrPs90E6d/view?usp=sharing) is printer friendly PDF for your content collection!

These longer form brew bits focusing on subclasses are aimed at giving you a full guide with examples to get your ideas out of your head and to the gaming table. Can't wait to see you back here for Part 2! We'll be looking at the core druid features, level 2 and level 6 features there. In the meantime, what do you think of Druid the Tides? Too much content? Is it ludicrously overpowered? Do you love it, hate it, or are you somewhere in the middle? Let us know over on twitter @DesignerDungeons #BrewBits!
