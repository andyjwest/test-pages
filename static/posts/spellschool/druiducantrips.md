For the first time ever, I'm happy to presnet a new style of article- Spell School!

Spell School articles are aimed at creating brand new content to add directly to your game. These will be paired down the road with our officially released adventures and moduals, but will be avalible here for free! I'll be talking about why you'd want to introduce this spell at the table, what situations it'll shine in, and creative ways to offer these new options as expanded rewards to players. 

School is now in session!

### PDF 
As with most of our other articles, we'll be providing printer friendly PDFs of the new content presented here with each article. 

[Here]() is the first ever Spell School PDF. Enjoy!
 
## New Druid Utility Cantrips
The druid class is a unique beast to design for in 5e. The duality of wild shape and spellcasting make some features difficult to use and others oppressively strong. 

One thing the class is lacking is powerful utility cantrips like *mage hand* and *minor illusion*. Outside of elemental evil, druids have the following unique cantrips no other classes have access to: *druidcraft*, *produce flame*, *shilleglah*, *thorn whip*. 

All of these cantrips have utility out of combat, but none bring unique utility to the class like *mage hand* brings the arcane casters. So today, we're giving druids some new tools to explore the world and creatively solve problems the other classes can't. 

Without further ado, here are sprout and conjure tiny woodland beasts!

### Sprout 
Conjuration cantrip

Casting time: 1 Action.

Range: Touch

Components: Verbal (Grow in Druidic), Material (a patch of dirt, a seed, and a drop of water)

You touch a handfull of unoccupied loose dirt. One of the following small plants of your choice sprouts up from the dirt
- A scrawny bush grows, filling a 5x5  area above the dirt. Hiding lightly obscures whoever is behind or inside it.
- A sturdy sapling grows. While uprooted and wielded, the sprout acts as a quarterstaff. 
- A grouping of vines sprouts up, growing up to 15 feet an adjacent wall. The vines can be safely climbed.

You can have at most one plant grown with this feature at a time. Whenever you grow a new plant, the last plant you have grown withers and vanishes. 

> ### Alternate Plants
> Instead of conjuring one of those three plants, a player might want to grow a unique plant to approach a specific problem. Instead of a shrub to hide behind, a player might want to spout flowers to attract an insect or a cactus to clog up space with its needles. 
> Whatever plant the player wants to conjure ultimately is done with DM permission, and should be kept around the same power level of other plants or similar conjuration cantrips. 


### Conjure Tiny Woodland Beast
Conjuration cantrip

Casting time: 1 Minute.

Range: Self

Components: Verbal (a loud animal call), Somatic

You summon a small woodland creature from the local area. After 1 minute, a tiny CR 0 beast from the environment approaches you if able. 

The following table contains some examples, and can be rolled on randomly if desired.

|d12|Beast| d12| Beast|
|:--:|:--|:--:|:--|
|1| Frog|7| Owl|
|2| Bat|8|Rat|
|3| Cat|9|Raven|
|4| Crab|10|Scorpion|
|5| Hawk|11|Spider|
|6| Lizard|12|Weasel| 

The creature treats you as friendly, but won't naturally follow commands. After 1 minute, unless it is charmed, it flees if able, and vanishes if unable. 

### Creative Solutions 
The core goal behind adding these cantrips to the druid class is to provide tools characters can use to embelish their theme and bring unique tools to the group for world exploration. 

The class could use some additional tools that function similarly to *minor illusion* and *mage hand*, but are unique to the druid ascetic and do disctinctly different things. 

Both of these cantrips dramatically improve a druid's utility out of combat at first level. *Sprout* can shape the world and give druids tools create cover, climb surfaces, and potentially so much more. *Summon Tiny Woodland Creature* gives players a critter to ask questions to, charm, shove off down a hallway, or adopt and charm as a pet. 

### Closing Thoughts
What do you think about these two cantrips? Does druid have enough exploration early? Do these two cantrips give players tools they'd want to use, or unneccisary improvements? Let me know on Twitter @DesignerDungeons #SpellSchools!
