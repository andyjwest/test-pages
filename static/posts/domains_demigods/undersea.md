# Domains and Demigods: Undersea Worldbuilding 

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/34/ac/5034acc923c35ae5e11a1aea1e21bc10.jpg">

A blue dragonborn captain garbed in a metal diving suit slides down the anchor chain from his ship above. Below through crystal clear water, a dim light blinks from a sunken ship coated in coral and kelp. The surrounding reef's vibrant colors and bizzare creatures contrast the wooden wreck on the sea floor. The dragonborn's crew had already set up camp inside and have been searching every inch for the treasure stolen from the captain. The blinking singaled something important was found- this better be worth his time and not another wild goose chase else the signaller would never return to the surface. 

A slender merfolk man garbed in plain stone jewelery glides through the crystal clear water leading a pack of giant crabs. Nets hold domesticated fish to each giant crab's work harnesses as they scuttle around the sea life coating the floor. Vibrant rose, turquoise, and maroon coral decorates the elaborate merfolk homes and businesses, each with varying indivuals doing their daily chores and tasks. The market he appraoaches is a huge area of anchored shops from the sea floor to the surface, each uniquely decorated with symbols, signs, and structures of the sea. 

Adventurers spend most time adventuring above water. The ocean floor is largely an overlooekd mystery in these worlds when it could home to captivating and thrilling ecosystems and adventure. Some seafaring adventures involve island hopping and shipboard combat, but miss exploring the huge space of water they're crossing. 

Dungeons and Dragons has a rich history of monsters, and many can be the starting point to a diverse and rich underwater world. So much of our planet is made up of diverse aquatic ecosystems, and through the lense of fantasy we can explore these areas and emblish these diveregent, alien environments. 
Today on Domains and Demigods, we're bringing the ocean floor to life. From adventuring environments to the denizens of the deep, we'll be covering everything you need to start world building new places for your players to explore and adventure. 

### Player Options
To go along with our theme here are two aquatic totems for the path of the totem warrior barbarian subclass. Each is ready to dive into aquatic combat, but also bring a touch of the sea to shore. 

[Here]() is a printer friendly link to the two options. Barbarians can make great guides, especially when paired with these two totems. From grisled veteran sailors decorated with shark teeth to slippery triton navigators, these aquatic options can give players new ways to explore the deep. 

In addition to these new barbarian options, I've included a few beast stat blocks for druids and DMs alike! Welcome the Jellyfish, Giant Jellyfish, Sea Turtle, and Giant Sea Turtle to the D&D multiverse!

But enough about players- onward to world buidling!

## Worlds Beaneath the Waves
Beneath the waves is a magical world of mystery and majesty. Aquatic adventures tend to favor coves, caves, and ships while missing out on one of the greatest adventuring areas out there. Diverse environments, flora, fauna, and sunken objects create natural and magical areas that can inspire any character. Creatures of the deep are abundant in the Mosnter Manual. Their homes and tribal societies could populate the sea floor like the races of the land populate the Sword Coast.

There are plenty of diverse environments to explore under water. Players can explore deep, dark cave systems full of noxious geysers and horrific creatures as well as vibrant, peaceful reefs home to exotic and chromatic flora and fauna. Monstrous shrines of long forgotten gods may rest down here as well, ripe with riches of a drowned civilization. 

Underwater adventuring can be a challenge to start, but once players have reached a point where the the lack of oxygen and pressure is no longer an issue, deep dives beneath the waves can double the area avalible to explore. This domains and demigods looks to give DMs and players more tools to play with in the world under the sea. As they saying goes, "Everything's better, down where its wetter, under the sea!"

#### Reef
Coral reefs are home to diverse aquatic flora and fauna, and transition perfectly into the realm of fantasy. Just a few minutes on Google images looking through coral reef photography can inspire all kinds of amazing ideas to populate these areas in your fantasy worlds. 

##### Denizens
The fey are a natural fit to these colorful and magical ecosystems. Aquatic variants of pixies with sea horse tails in place of wings could protect their home with powerful illusions. A coral dryad could have symbiotic relationships with the fish that live within their hair and body, and might be able to telepathically communicate with them. 

Coral myconids could call these reefs their home. Instead of hostile vine blights, a seagrass blight could wrap around unsuspecting vitcims necks and strangle them. Giant anemones can make for excellent hazards or homes to certain symbiotic life. Gargantuan, bizzare sea worms can make for excellent epic encounters. 

Outside of magical creatures, mundane creatures like octopi thrive in these colorful environments. A giant octopus might appear seemingly out of nowhere. A group of shrimp might be seen producing bright sparks of light as they hunt smaller prey. Merfolk also would make excellent protectors or inhabitants of these areas. 

##### Reef Descriptions
When describing reefs, a focus on color and creature diversity is key to making it come to life. Not much else in reality is as vibrant as a coral reef. Grandeous description of near neon colors and the exotic patterned creatures that live around the coral takes a generic coral reef and helps immerse players into a truly magical world. 

|d6|Description|
|:--|:--|
|1| Glowing teal tendrils gently flow with the currents. Clown fish swim about them, nipping up nearby green specs of algae.
|2| A shelf coated in a rainbow assortment of plant life, each with strange distinct structure. Five thick blue tubes reach out from a single prickly ball in the middle with a bush like cream plant coated in pointed spikes to its left.
|3| Through a tunnel of colorful coral swim small groups of translucent fish and lone exotic fish. Some are pointed and flat with black and white stripes, others spherical and covered in pins. 
|4| An arch covered in dark brown and green coral wraps around a channel carrying bubbles out from beneath the sea floor. 
|5| Parting the fifteen to twenty feet long patches of kelp reveals a huge array of colored discs and leafs sprout from a rocky base. Vibrant fish navigate around the complex layers of color and life stretching out for miles to come.
|6| A school of tiny orange fish glide above the the similarly colored coral below. They swim almost as if they were dancing syncronosly, each movement part of a greater work of art.

##### Reef Plot Hooks
How do you get players invested in exploring these environments? Here are some ideas to answer that complex question and get the creative juices flowing. 

|d4|Plot Hook|
|:--:|:--|
|1| A druid needs escorted to an endangered reef to cleanse the necromancy magic killing it. 
|2| A renowned zoologist is looking for a crew to defend and assist a reasearch project looking for new species at an unexplored reef. 
|3| Merfolk have opened invitations to their yearly festival celebrating their pantheon to outsiders for the first time. Their city is built around a beautiful reef.
|4| A rare species of shellfish is worth tremendous amounts of gold for their magical properties. One of the last known homes to these endangered creatures is a largely uncharted reef.

#### Shipwrecks
Sunken ships can be some of the most exciting environments to explore. They can easily be paired with undead sailors to create spooky, gritty encounters but just as easily can work with overgrown sea life. 

These areas also scale great in size. The site of a huge naval battle could leave a village to city size area covered in now populated sunken ships beneath the waves ready to explore. Sentient races might retrofit these ships into practical homes.
