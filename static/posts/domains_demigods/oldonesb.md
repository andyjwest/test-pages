## Followers and NPCs of the Great Old Ones 
"The locals seemed a bit peculiar at first. Honestly, I just assumed my plumage and chipper spirit was a bit unsettling for them at first. After a few days I knew something was wrong. A mysterious absence of children tipepd me off that something disturbing was going on here, something that laughter couldn't cure. Cryptic messages and haunting screams turned dream to nightmare, and came to visit night after night. I was in Hamlet looking for work, looking for stories to tell. What happened next, well... no words from a jester like me can come close to depicting the monsters lying in wait beneath the town."

- Mercutio, travelling human bard

Hello again fellow adventurers! Here at Designer Dungeons, we are out to give players and DMs plenty of tools to drop into their world and shape fun and memorable gaming sessions with friends. This time around, we are venturing back to our past Domains and Deities topic: the Great Old Ones. We're taking a deeper dive into NPCs and villians of these stories. Framing of events and environment set the scene, but dialog and action drives the story forward towards its epic conclusion. 

Before venturing further, I'd recommend heading back [here]() to catch up on how cosmic horror and environment mesh together with the Great Old Ones in DnD.

### Followers

Followers dedicated Great Old Ones  tend to share their patorn's goals or overlook them in exchange for power. 
They speak in mad tongues and sew insanity into the people around them. A small hamlet on the outskirts of town with a dedicated temple to maddness might appear normal on the surface, but small quirks and strange mannerisms with the townsfolk can hint at a sinister underlying plot lying in wait. Alternatively, a nobles estate and lavish gala used as to abduct 

The following few tables can help mix and match basic appearances of a follower of Old Gods with significant features and unique traits to set up some basic appearances you can present to your players. Most races can mix well with these appearances. Venturing outside the norm can bring a whole new angle to the adventure and subvert some common expectations players might have while staying with the overall feel of a cosmic horror game.

|d10| Basic Apperance| d10 |Unique Feature/Trait|

#### NPC Types 
Once you have your appearances worked out it can be useful to decide on what kind of NPCs fit your clergy. There is a huge array of options avalible with some clever reflavoring, even touching on some weirder creatures like Mind Flayers and Oozes.

There are other ways to make your NPCs feel like they belong to a cosmic horror setting. Odd expressions and reppedtive speach are two examples. Consider detailed descriptions focused around eccentricities and oddities important NPCs have. A insane mayor might be wearing a tower of worn, patched hats. Perceptive party members might even notice that the stitching on the patches draws shapes, and incredibly perceptive party members could identify those shapes as monstrous faces of creatures unknown to the party.

#### Spell Services
NPCs in service to world eating beings might not at first seem like the go to place for players to get some useful spells, but like any clergy in fantasy settings, they can offer their unique list of spells to aid players... **for a price.** 

This price can be a great way to immerse players into the insanity before them as it will involve players in part of the maddness. Below are two tables; one showcases some options for spell services members of maddness domains and warlocks of great old ones might have. The other presents some ideas in place of traditional currency a player might have to pay in place of gold for the varying spell levels avalible.
