New article time-Treasures and Toolboxes! These have been a long work in progress, but I finally am confident in the material to publish it for you all to see.

These articles are aimed at creating brand new content to add directly to your game. The content here will be paired down the road with our officially released adventures and modules. You’ll get a lot of the content here first though, for free!

I'll be talking about why you'd want to introduce these additions to the table, what situations they will shine in, and creative ways to offer these new options as expanded rewards to players when possible.

### PDF
As with most of our other articles, we'll be providing printer friendly PDFs of the new content presented here with each article.

[Here]() is the first ever Treasures and Toolboxes PDF. Enjoy!
 
## New Druid Utility Cantrips
The druid class is a unique beast to design for in 5e. The duality of wild shape and spellcasting make some features difficult to use and others oppressively strong.

One thing the class is lacking is powerful utility cantrips like *mage hand* and *minor illusion*. Outside of the *Elemental Evil Player's Companion,*, druids have the following unique cantrips no other classes have access to: *druidcraft*, *produce flame*, *shillelagh*, and *thorn whip*.

All four have a bit of utility out of combat, but none can match the arcane utility cantrips. We're giving druids new tools to explore the world and creatively solve problems the other classes can't as well as fill in some early gaps in theme druids suffer from.

Without further ado, here are *sprout* and *conjure tiny woodland beast*!

>### Sprout
> Conjuration cantrip
>
> Casting time: 1 Action.
>
> Range: Touch
>
> Components: Verbal (Grow in Druidic), Material (a patch of dirt, a seed, and a drop of water)

> Duration: Instantaneous 
>
> You touch a handful of unoccupied loose dirt. One of the following inedible plants of your choice sprouts up from the dirt
>- A scrawny bush fills a 5x5  area. Characters behind or inside it are lightly obscured. 
>- A sturdy sapling grows. It can be uprooted and used as a quarterstaff.
>- A grouping of vines sprouts up, growing up to 15 feet an adjacent wall. The vines can be safely climbed.
>
> You can have at most one plant grown with this feature at a time. Whenever you cast this spell, the last plant you have grown withers and vanishes.

#### Alternate Plants
 Instead of conjuring one of those three plants, a player might want to grow a unique plant to approach a specific problem. Instead of a shrub to hide behind, a player might want to spout flowers to attract an insect or a cactus to clog up space with its needles.

Whatever plant the player wants to conjure ultimately is done with DM permission. I’d recommend trying to keep the plants power around that of the others, or slightly weaker than another cantrip effect. I’d advise keeping the plants size within a 5x10 foot area. 

>### Conjure Tiny Woodland Beast
>Conjuration cantrip
>
>Casting Time: 1 action
>
>Range: 90 feet
>
>Components: Verbal (“Come little one” in druidic), Material (A bit of seed, meat, or other animal food)
>
>Duration: Up to 1 hour
>
>You summon a tiny or small CR 0 woodland creature from the local area that appears within range. The DM chooses the type of animal to appear.
>
>*The following table contains some examples, and can be rolled on randomly if desired.*

|d12|Beast| d12| Beast
|:--:|:--|:--:|:--
|1| Frog|7| Owl|
|2| Bat|8|Rat|
|3| Cat|9|Raven|
|4| Crab|10|Scorpion|
|5| Hawk|11|Spider|
|6| Lizard|12|Weasel|

>The beast treats you as friendly, but won't naturally follow commands. It actions are determined by the DM. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, when the spell ends, or when you cast this spell again.

### When to Introduce
If you are starting a new campaign and have played with early level druids before, this is probably a good time to offer these cantrips as possible choices. Druids, especially in the first few levels, can lack reusable ways to have a big impact on exploration and roleplay. Adding in these cantrips early will help boost up the unique nature of druid spellcasting and define what they are all about.

Alternately, you might want to introduce these cantrips if you have a frustrated mid level druid player looking for thematic tools to improve their core aesthetic. Offering up one of these as a reward or a purchasable additional option can rejuvenate a player looking for reasons to stick with their character.


### Creative Solutions
The core goal behind adding these cantrips to the druid class is to provide tools characters can use to embellish their theme and bring unique abilities to the group for world exploration.

The wonderful thing about utility cantrips like these is players will find ways to surprise you and shine with them. A tavern could be spooked by a spontaneous rat that scurries over to the druid. When confronted with a locked cage, the druid might plant a scrawny, sharp shrub to give the rogue makeshift thieve's tools for lock picking.

If you are looking for direct ways to show players what kinds of situations these spells thrive in, consider adding in an object atop a single story building or inside a second story window. A druid with *sprout* can conjure vines to get the entire party up there. Woodland creatures fleeing from the woods unexpectedly could be a call to use *conjure tiny woodland beast* to recruit one for awhile. With some solid roleplay or a *speak with animals* spell, this summoned creature acts as an important NPC that can explain mysterious hazards ahead.

### Easy Introduction
Here are three easy ways to add these cantrips to your game.


**1.** If you are starting a new game, offering these two cantrips to a druid at the table in addition to the regular druid cantrips can be compelling. Adding them to the druid spell list before 4th and 10th level also will provide druids easy opportunity to pick up one of these new tools.

**2.** Completing an objective for a natural quest giver might grant players regular rewards and a scroll leading to an ancient druid who has mastered one of these two spells that he can teach the druid as a bonus cantrip.

Selling these additional cantrips at a moderate price could also be an option for groups looking to pick up and run with both these cantrips that aren't too worried about the base game's power progression.

**3.** Convert them into magic items! Both could be attached to a druid only magic item that can be used freely. A pouch of animal feed would make an excellent vessel for *conjure tiny woodland beast*, while a small clay pot works for *sprout*. We'll call them the **Pouch of Companionship** and **Pot of Planting**. Slot them an uncommon or rare and add them to your loot tables or however you give out magic items!
