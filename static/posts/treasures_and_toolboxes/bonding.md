# Treasure and Toolboxes- Bonding: Encourage Group RP

Bonded is a new mechanic to introduce to your Dugneons and Dragon 5th eddition game. It rewards players from building relationships and telling stories together through bonuses to thematic rolls. Similar to inspiration, Bonding is something to inspire tables to be awesome together.

## Mechanics
>### Bonding
> Whenever two characters have a great moment of roleplay together, another player or the DM can reward them each with a **bond die**. The more eipc the roleplay moment, the larger the die (from d4 to d12). Each player record the die number and who its is bonded to. 
> Whenever a bonded character makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, the other bonded member can choose to consume their bond die and add it to the die roll. Both characters need to be able to percieve each other in order to benefit from a bond die. A player can choose to add the bond die after the roll is made, but before the results of the roll are announced. 

## Examples
Bond dice represent the gravity of roleplay moments. Some moments are fun and light, and offer a small reward while others are tug at the heartstrings and represent more than their mechanical weight. 

### Small Bond Dice
Gibby, the halfling rogue, and Flower, the gnome bard, spend an evening out on the town with the rest of the party. They think up a scheme, and Gibby hoistes Flower on to his shoulders. They grab their elven ranger's cloak and sneak off to the bar. Flower casts disguse self on herself, masking her appearance to look like an adult. They swindle some coin off of some drunken gamblers, and before they know what hit them, Gibby and Flower are back to their short stature, giggling with their allies and counting their prizes. 

The elven ranger's player rewards Gibby and Flower with d4 bond dice for a cute roleplay moment in the local tavern.

### Medium Bond Dice
Adrian, the half-elf paladin, and Pewter, the high elf Wizard, are locked in combat with a furious adult red dragon. Adrian has two option- charge the beast and leave his companion defensless, or stay back and protect his allie. He chooses to hold back, taking the dodge action and standing between the beast and Pewter. Pewter takes her action to cast Haste on Adrian to empower his defenses and prepare him for the incoming dragon's attacks. As the dragon flys at them both, breath blasting, the DM awards them both with a d8 bond die for staying together and looking out for each other in the face of danger. 

### Large Bond Dice
Tears are flowing as the dust settles. After months of adventuring together, Reed and Myra have made it back to their homelands. They walk in the gates, hand in hand, holding the head of the monster that oppressed their families for generations. The crowd erupts in cheer and excitement. They turn back to see their fellow adventurers they met along their journey, smiling ear to ear. 

The group awards them a d12 bond dice for coming together to overcome a major villian of their joint backstory, and those players held on to that bond die until the climax of the adventure.
