# Be a Better: Spellcrafter

## Spell Thematics and Theme 
### Unique Spell Components
### Spell Appearance 
### Examples 
#### Burning Hands > Magma Spike 
In place of a cone of fire in a 15 ft. cone, magma erupts from the ground beneath you, splashing in a 15 ft cone. The spells apperance shifts to maintain full spell functionallity, but thematically matches dwarven forge masters and earthen spell casters better. 

When the cone touches the ground, instead simply having the visual aspect of the spell be a stomp leading to the ground bursting open with a magmatic fissure (temporarily), the spell looks very different but functions identically. 

#### Tenser's Floating Disc > Kalimor's Traveling Chair 
Area, weight, and functionality remain  exactly the same, but instead nowthe disc's core purpose shifts from being a loot carrying device to a means of carrying an ally off the ground. The disc can shift slightly in form and color, becoming a disc more majestic than a blue floating object.

The spell doesn't functionally change, but its theme and purpose does. A wizard might take this spell as to always have a place to sit when preparing new spells in uncomfortable environments.
