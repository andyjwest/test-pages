>A parrot descends from a tropical palm tree to his master's body. The smell of grog and sweat emanate from the dozing swashbuckler.

>"Wah- who- ahhhhh!" She says, snapping awake and scaring her parrot. The buccaneer bolts upright, looking frantically about and scrambling about for her pistol and cutlass. As she stumbles to her feet, she grabs her head and gasps in pain as the  consequences of last night’s party crash down to her brain. She looks about hazily until coming to a startling conclusion.

>"*The Medallion*- they've taken me ship!"She snags her hat and clumsily rushes off down the beach. She fires her pistol into the air and begins shouting. The vessel she once captained disappears over the dawning horizon. Sounds of hooting and profanity coming in waves from the thieves.

>"Squawks, me boy, they don't know what trouble they've gone and got themselves in now. We'll catch that rat crew, take back our boat, just wait..." she mutters, grabbering flask from her waist and stumbling back towards port.

The modern pirate fantasy is akin to the modern day rock star. You drink too much, make bad choices, and get paid royally for it. The law isn't your friend, but you're you're not evil. You're an opportunist. In Dungeons and Dragons, pirates fit perfectly into the mercenary lifestyle most adventurers find themselves in. Sure, there are some law abiding citizens (cough cough PALADINS cough cough) but adventure favors those willing to bend and break the rules.

Today, on Be a Better, we'll be diving into archetypes and features to embellish pirate characters and help them be the best buckaroos they can be.

## Pirate Subclasses

Anyone can be a pirate. Start by taking the pirate background (a variant of sailor). Then all you need is a blatant disregard for the law, the unyielding desire for freedom, and a very fancy hat. 

How do you play like a pirate though? What features and subclasses are out there to best encapsulate the fantasy rockstar vibe?

We’ll start with subclasses, as some subclasses lend themselves to pirating better than others.

### Thief Rogue
The thief rogue is a classic example of what makes a pirate a pirate. The rogue by itself brings a lot to the table a buccaneer is looking for mechanically. Cunning action gets you darting around the battlefield and deftly navigating danger. Expertise in acrobatics and deception are the only real skills a pirate needs. Sneak attack emphasizes your willingness to fight dirty proves you know how to take advantage of a distracted foe. Thief takes these ideas to a whole new level.

Second story work has you navigating up and down masts of ships, swinging rope to rope and and climbing your way to safety and tactical positions. Fast hands has you deploying pocket sand, caltrops, or alchemist's fire (but never on board OUR ship, you'll kill us all ye reckless knave!)  as a bonus action. This emphasizes the tried and true pirate tactic of taking every advantage you’ve got. You're allowed to cheat. You're a pirate.

### Tempest Cleric
We do a full 180 and find ourselves at the cleric class. Not only do the subclasses expanded spells work superbly on a ship, the core class offers up excellent navigation and healing tools for whenever you and your crew get in a jam. With navigation aided by *guidance*, shipboard repairs  made through *mending*, and *create food and water* creating sustenance over long journeys, clerics bring a plethora of tools useful all across a pirate crew.

Tempest domain gives proficiency with martial weapons which opens up clerics to a melee lifestyle. Pair that with destructive wrath and wrath of the storm and you have a lightning wielding viking able to bring the storm god's fury to any mercantile vesel who dare challenge your pillaging. *Gust of wind*, *fog cloud* and *call lightning* all provide insanely powerful tools to use during shipboard combat. Tempest domain really flourishes in a seafaring campaign. 

### Battle Master Fighter
Want to play a classic swashbuckler? Look no further than the battle master fighter. When selecting a fighting style, dueling stands out as the most cinematic fighting style while two-weapon fighting can just as easily fit the pirate theme. Action surge provides more defined moments to be the center of attention. Consider using this additional action to do something thematic and empowering as opposed to just making more attacks, though. Climbing on to a bigger creature, pushing a target to the ground, or disengaging to navigate in and out of the thick of things all will both empower what your character is doing while making them *look* and *feel* more like a pirate.

Battle master takes notes from action surge and opens up a ton of tools to add to your arsenal. Literally every martial maneuver is something I could easily see a practitioner of plundering deploying. You can trip your enemies, riposte their strikes, command your allies, intimidate your foes, and so much more.

If that wasn't enough you even pick up a hobby! Specialize with proficiency in navigator's tools to emphasize your role as the ships navigator and pilot or pick up cook's tools to provide better meals to the scallywags aboard your ship.

In this same vein I can't recommend enough the martial adept feat to anyone looking to improve their pirate-y-ness. It gives your character a maneuver die and a pair of maneuvers. They are the most pirate like features in the Player's Handbook.

> #### Play Pattern and Flavor
>
>All three of these subclasses share one major trait: melee. A pirate is at home with a flintlock pistol in one hand and a cutlass in the other. To drive this home, consider reflavoring a hand crossbow as a pistol and a shortsword as a cutlass. Nothing needs to change mechanically; these flavor changes will only empower a characters aesthetic. 



## Dirty Fighting

A combat focused play pattern will lend to characters wanting to take risks. Being front and center will lead to more cinematic moments but also put characters in the direct line of fire. Rogues and fighters both naturally can handle this with tools like action surge and cunning action, but other classes might struggle to embody the pirate persona and stay alive.

Another core element of pirating is the principle that “No pirate is ever caught unarmed.” The dirt beneath your feet makes for a hazard and a broken bottle can be as lethal as any knife.

Taking this concept to gameplay is trickier than it looks. Outside of thief, it can be genuinely difficult to be rewarded mid combat for using sand, ball bearings and other tricky tools.

### Mobility Features
Features that improve your speed and battlefield navigation increase the power of utility items and features. Being able to safely deploy oil and light it on fire showcases a willingness to outwit enemies and win by any means necessary.

The mobile feat is the easiest way to pick up some bonus mobility. It lets you hit and run with ease which makes it the best mobility feature a pirate can have if they don't have normal ways to get out of combat safely. If you're playing a sorcerer, paladin, or other class lacking in great tools for disengagement and increased movement, mobile can be the feat for you. If you are in love with this core play pattern, consider starting as a variant human to begin the game already mobile.

Monks and barbarians also both naturally get faster and can easily get to prime positions to deploy hazards. Smaller races, namely halflings, can use this speed to navigate in even trickier ways. Being able to hide in spaces too small for larger monsters to navigate can protect otherwise vulnerable characters. 

Playing with the tumble rule variant from the DMG emphasizes this kind of mobility. I highly recommend using most of the movement and combat based variant rules for pirate centric games as they mix perfectly with the core fantasy.

### Utility
Now that you are moving around an area like a pro, consider how to prevent enemies from doing the same. Hit and run is only good if you're faster than your foes. Ways to create difficult terrain is the easiest way to empower this style of play. Ball bearings and caltrops are two easy ways any character can hinder enemy navigation. Items like oil and flint and steel can create terrain enemies get punished for navigating through, and can make great tools early to block an area.

Spells like *entangle* fit this category well. If you and allies are set to take aerial advantage, an *entangle* spell can simply root your enemies in place and leave them sitting quietly while you pick them to pieces. *Fog cloud* and *grease* both have similar effects on enemies.

*Command, suggestion,* and other mind altering charms and illusions can be even more effective. Setting up an encounter by simply suggesting an alternative to direct confrontation that may or may not lead them directly into an ambush can be invaluable.
Other martial weapons like whips and nets can both act as damaging tools as well as utility items. A whip can easily act as 10 feet of rope in the right circumstances. It has finesse and reach, making staying 35 feet ahead of enemies easy peasy.
Many generic actions are underrated and fit well into this category. Shoving a creature to knock it prone sets up all of your melee allies to harry blows on the targeted creature. Classes other than rogue can hide, and doing so can put you in positions monsters aren't ready for. Instead of running straight through the next door, consider hiding immediately to the right inside a room. When the monster passes you, you'll be attacking from an unseen place and can take full advantage of its poor perception.

## Thematic Additions

We've talked a lot about fighting like a pirate, but being a pirate is as much (if not more) about lifestyle than battle. Here are some features that support your image and bring some much needed tools to navigating the dangerous world of piracy.

### Animal Companionship
Find familiar is a spell that effectively gives you a pet raven. With a tiny bit of fluff, it can look, sound, and act as a parrot! The best part is any character can easily grab this spell with either the magic adept or ritual caster feat. In either case, having a familiar is a huge boon when navigating and exploring unfamiliar territory. If a bird doesn't suit your fancy, consider fluffing a weasel to act as a pet monkey. If you really want a climbing monkey, consider reflavoring a spider (yeah, it's weird) as it fits the size category, has spider climb, and is actually quite handy at navigation. If he does end up biting somebody, just say his poison is some pirate disease. Maybe it just ate a bad banana.

If you are all in on having an animal as a core part of your play style, the beast master ranger offers a huge diversity of options. My personal favorite is the giant crab. I just adore the idea of a halfling pirate waving a pistol around and wearing an eye-patch riding atop their giant crab and shouting profanity. It speaks to me.

### Dress to Impress
Your characters description is your own. Work with your DM to appear how you'd like in your armor. You don't need to look like you're in studded leather armor all the time. Mechanically, having the armor will keep you alive. As far as flavor goes, I want a dirty suit coat with no undershirt. I want to be wearing dress pants cut off at one knee and the finest hat 5 gold can buy.

Buy and carry ale with you at all times. Consider having animals just for hauling around barrels of mead and grog. I’d go so far to even consider refluffing oil as hard liquor, giving it a dual purpose on pirate themed characters.

An eye-patch doesn't need to impair a character, either. Peg legs can be thematic and fun. Whenever DMing for pirate characters, I'd seriously consider allowing players to be as descriptive as they want to bring these characters to life. Describing dark eyeliner and a couple golden teeth doesn't inherently power up a character mechanically. It does power them up as a story element, and will make your world more immersive.
Separating character mechanics and storytelling largely involves saying yes. Nothing needs to change mechanically in the game to allow for pistols to exist. The loading quality of a hand crossbow as well as its size can mechanically function as intended while simultaneously giving players tools to look and feel as pirate-y as they want.
